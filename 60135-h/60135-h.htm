<h2>PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION</h2>

<p>Since the first publication of “Mexico and
Her People of To-day,” Mexico has seen stirring
times, and there has been a radical change
in the government. Revolution again broke
forth, and the long dictatorship of Porfirio
Diaz has ended. These conditions have made
advisable a completely revised edition of this
work, which the public and the press have
stamped with their approval to a degree that
has been most pleasing. To both public and
press the author desires to return his most
sincere thanks, and he has in this revision endeavoured
to be as accurate and painstaking
as in the original preparation. Furthermore,
another trip to that most interesting country
has enabled the author to give a description of
a section but briefly treated in the previous
edition. New appendices have been added, consisting
of a bibliography and a few suggestions
for those contemplating a trip to Mexico.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Many books have been written about Mexico,
but several of the best works were written a
quarter of a century ago and are now out of
print. This fact and the developments of the
past few years leads the author to believe that
there is a field for another book on that most
interesting country; a book that should present
in readable form reliable information concerning
the customs and characteristics of the people
of Mexico, as well as the great natural resources
of the country and their present state
of development, or lack of development.</p>

<p>It has been the aim of the author to make a
complete and accurate presentation of the subject
rather than to advance radical views concerning
and harsh criticism of our next-door
neighbours. With this idea in mind he has
read nearly every prominent work on Mexico
and Mexican history, as well as other current
periodical literature concerning that country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
during the two years devoted to the preparation
of this volume. It is hoped that the wide
range of subjects, covering the customs, habits,
amusements, history, antiquities, and resources
will render the volume of value to any one
interested in Mexico and her progress.</p>

<p>If this volume shall aid in any way to a better
understanding of Mexico by Americans, or
in furthering the present progressive movement
in that country, then the author will feel
amply repaid for the months of labour devoted
to its preparation.</p>

<p>The author wishes to make special acknowledgment
of obligation to his friend Mr. C. R.
Birt, his companion during the greater part of
his travels through Mexico, and to whose artistic
sense in selection and grouping the excellence
of many of the photographs herewith
reproduced is due.</p>

<h1>MEXICO AND HER PEOPLE TO-DAY</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">AZTEC LAND</span></h2>

<p>Prescott says: “Of all that extensive empire
which once acknowledged the authority of
Spain in the New World, no portion for interest
and importance, can be compared with Mexico;—and
this equally, whether we consider the
variety of its soil and climate; the inexhaustible
stores of its mineral wealth; its scenery,
grand and picturesque beyond example; the
character of its ancient inhabitants, not only
far surpassing in intelligence that of the other
North American races, but reminding us, by
their monuments, of the primitive civilization of
Egypt and Hindoostan; or, lastly, the peculiar
circumstances of its conquest, adventurous and
romantic as any legend devised by Norman or
Italian bard of chivalry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Mexico is a country in which the old predominates.
The American visitor will bring back
more distinct recollections of the Egyptian
carts and plows, the primitive manners and
customs, than he will of the evidences of modern
civilization. An educated Mexican whom
I met, chided the Americans for this tendency,
for, said he, “all that is written of Mexico is
descriptive of the Indians and their habits,
while progressive Mexico is ignored.” This is
to a great extent true, for it is the unique and
ancient that attracts and holds the attention of
the traveller. For this reason tourists go to
Egypt to see the pyramids, sphinx and tombs
of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for the traveller to venture
out upon perilous seas to see mute evidences
of a life older than printed record. In
this land of ancient civilization and primitive
customs, there are cities which stand out like
oriental pearls transplanted to the Occident
from the shores of the Red Sea. Here in
Mexico can be found pyramids which are no
mean rivals to those great piles on the Egyptian
deserts; crumbling ruins of tombs, and
palaces, and temples, ornamented in arabesque
and grecque designs, not unlike the structures
along the banks of the mighty Nile; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
same primitive implements of husbandry
which we have viewed so often in the pages of
the large family Bible. Then, as an additional
attraction, there is the actual presence of the
aborigines, Aztec, Zapotec, and Chichimec,
speaking the same language, observing the
same ceremonies, and following the same customs
which were old when the foreigners
came.</p>

<p>There is no history to enlighten us as to the
age of these monuments, and there are few
hieroglyphics to be deciphered upon which a
Rosetta Stone might shed light. The student
is led to wonder whether the Egyptian civilization
antedated the Mexican, or whether the
former is simply the Mexican learning and
skill transplanted to the Orient and there modified
and improved. It is quite possible, that,
while our own ancestors were still barbarians,
and little better than savages, swarming over
northern Europe, the early races in Mexico
had developed a civilization advanced and progressive.
They knew how to build monuments
which in masonry and carving teach us lessons
to-day. They made beautiful pottery and
artistic vessels, and they used gold for money
and ornaments.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that for a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
miles the republics of Mexico and the
United States join, the average American
knows less concerning Mexico than he does of
many European countries; and it is much misunderstood
as well as misrepresented. Mexico
possesses the strongest possible attractions for
the tourist. Its scenic wonders are unsurpassed
in any other part of the globe in natural picturesqueness;
and no country in Europe presents
an aspect more unfamiliar and strange
to American eyes, or exceeds it in historic interest.</p>

<p>Vast mountains including snow-capped Popocatapetl
and Ixtaccihuatl, the loftiest peaks
on the American continent, are seen here amid
scenes of tropical beauty and luxuriance.
Great cities are found with their customs and
characteristics almost unchanged since they
were built by the Spaniards; and there are
still more ancient cities and temples which
were built by prehistoric races.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus2">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SNOW-CAPPED POPOCATAPETL</p>
</div>

<p>It is a land of tradition and romance, and of
picturesque contrasts. At almost every turn
there is something new, unique, interesting, and
even startling. It has all the climates from the
torrid zone to regions of perpetual snow on the
summits of the lofty volcanic peaks, and is
capable of producing nearly every fruit found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
between the equator and the Arctic circle. The
softness and sweetness of the air; the broken
and ever-varying line of rugged hills against
a matchless sky; the beautiful views between
the mountain ranges; the care-free life which
is omnipresent each add their charm to the
composite picture. Dirt is everywhere and
poverty abounds, but even these are removed
from the commonplace by the brilliant colour
on every hand.</p>

<p>F. Hopkinson Smith in “A White Umbrella
in Mexico” epitomizes this marvellously attractive
country as follows: “A land of white
sunshine, redolent with flowers; a land of gay
costumes, crumbling churches, and old convents;
a land of kindly greetings, of extreme
courtesy, of open, broad hospitality. It was
more than enough to revel in an Italian sun,
lighting up a semi-tropical land; to look up
to white-capped peaks, towering into blue; to
look down upon wind-swept plains, encircled by
ragged chains of mountains; to catch the
sparkle of miniature cities, jewelled here and
there in oases of olive and orange; and to realize
that to-day, in its varied scenery, costumes,
architecture, street life, canals crowded with
flower-laden boats, market plazas thronged
with gaily-dressed natives, faded church interiors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and abandoned convents, Mexico is the
most marvellously picturesque country under
the sun. A tropical Venice! A semi-barbarous
Spain! A new Holy Land.”</p>

<p>Mexico contains a greater area than is generally
understood. It is shaped very much like
a cornucopia with an extreme length of nineteen
hundred miles, a breadth of seven hundred
and fifty miles, and an area of nearly
eight hundred thousand square miles. At its
narrowest point, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,
it is only one hundred and twenty-five miles
across from ocean to ocean. There is a double
range of mountains, one near the Pacific coast
and the other near the coast of the Gulf of
Mexico, between which lie the great table lands,
or plateaus, which constitute a large part of
the surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="illus3">

</div>

<p>Three distinct climates are found in Mexico
determined by altitude. Those regions six
thousand feet or more above sea level are
called the <i>tierras frias</i>, or cold lands. This is
only a relative term, for the cold does not correspond
with that of our own northern states.
Though termed “cold,” the mean temperature
is not lower than that of Central Italy. Those
lands lying at an altitude of six thousand feet,
down to three thousand feet, above sea level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
are termed the <i>tierras templadas</i>, or temperate
lands. This is a region of perpetual humidity
and is semi-tropical in its vegetation and temperature.
An altitude from four thousand to
six thousand feet in Mexico gives a most delightful
climate.</p>

<p>Along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts
there is a more or less broad tract called the
<i>tierra caliente</i>, or hot land, which is a truly
tropical region. Forests of dense growth cover
the soil, so thick that it is impossible to penetrate
them without blazing your way as you go,
and in the midst of which tower trees of magnificent
size, such as are to be seen only in the
tropics. Here it is that nature is over-prodigal
in her gifts; and here it is that the <i>vomito</i>, as
yellow fever is called, lurks with fatal effect.
The winds from the sea generally mitigate the
fierce heat, especially if one can remain out of
the sun during the middle of the day. Sometimes
these winds on the Atlantic coast acquire
great velocity, and burst forth upon the unprotected
shores with terrific fury as the so-called
“northers.” There is no true winter
here, but there is a rainy season from June to
October, and a dry season from November to
May, the former being the colder.</p>

<p>“In the course of a few hours,” says Prescott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
“the traveller may experience every gradation
of climate, embracing torrid heat and
glacial cold, and pass through different zones
of vegetation including wheat and the sugar-cane,
the ash and the palm, apples, olives, and
guavas.” The dwellings vary also. In the hot
lands the habitations are constructed of bamboo
and light poles open to sun and wind, for
the only shelter needed is protection from the
elements; in the temperate region the huts are
made of heavier poles, and are somewhat more
durable; in the higher lands they are built of
adobe or stone. Sugar cane and coffee, and
even the banana, will grow up to four thousand
feet. Wheat grows best at six thousand
feet and pines commence here too. At seven
thousand feet cactus appears, and the <i>maguey</i>,
ushering in an entirely different zone. Mexico
is a country of extremes of heat and cold, poverty
and riches, filth and cleanliness, education
and extreme ignorance.</p>

<p>Every schoolboy knows of Loch Katrine and
Loch Lomond in bonnie Scotland, and most people
are familiar with the location of Lago di
Como, in Italy. And yet I should not be
surprised if fair-sized towns could be found
in the United States where no one could tell
whether such a body of water as Lake Chapala<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
existed or not. As a matter of fact it is ten
times as large as all the lakes of Northern
Italy combined; and it embraces islands larger
than the entire surface of Loch Lomond. Its
steely blue waters and rugged shores need
only the magic pen of the novelist or poet to
tell of its beauties and invest each nook and
glen with romance, and the charming villas
of Como to make Chapala as picturesque and
fascinating as those better known lakes. It is
almost a hundred miles long and thirty-three
miles wide at the widest point, and covers fourteen
hundred square miles. Patzcuaro and
Cuitzeo are also lakes of considerable size near
Chapala, and all of them are six thousand feet
or more above sea level. They only await development
and advertising to become popular
resorts.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the inhabitants of Mexico
are descendants of Indian races who were
found there by the Spanish conquerors, and
mixtures of those natives with European settlers.
Of the fourteen millions of inhabitants
only about nineteen per cent. are white; of the
remainder, forty-three per cent. are Indians and
thirty-eight per cent. mixed. There is a greater
resemblance of the Mexican Indians to the
Malay races of Asia than to the American Indians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Their intensely black hair and eyes,
brown complexion, small stature, and even a
slight obliquity of the eyes bear a strong resemblance
to the Japanese. I have seen it
stated that, if a Japanese is dressed in Mexican
costume, and a Mexican in Japanese dress, it
is difficult to tell which is the Jap and which
the Mexican. Students of languages say that
there is a strong similarity between the Mexican
tongues and oriental languages. The different
tribes do not mingle much and seldom
intermarry, and this fact may contribute to
their physical deterioration.</p>

<p class="caption">AN INDIAN MAIDEN</p>
</div>

<p>Whence came this people? No one can answer.
It is generally supposed that the Aztecs
came from what are now the south-western
states of the Union, and wandered into the
Valley of Mexico. They were defeated by the
tribes then dwelling there, and sought refuge
on the shores of Lake Texcoco. There they
beheld a golden eagle of great size and beauty
resting on a prickly cactus and devouring a
serpent which it held in its talons, and with its
wings outstretched toward the rising sun. This
was the sign for which they had been looking,
and there they proceeded to erect their capital.
They first built houses of rushes and reeds in
the shallow water and lived upon fish, and constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
floating gardens. As the waters receded
somewhat they built more durable structures,
including great palaces and temples.
They extended their sway over neighbouring
races beyond the Valley and conquered tribe
after tribe, although never claiming dominion
over more than a small portion of the present
confines of Mexico. The legend of the eagle
and the cactus is still preserved in the coat-of-arms
of the present republic.</p>

<p>Of the Aztecs and their history prior to the
conquest little is known, except that the country
was called Anahuac. Prescott has made
his “Conquest of Mexico” as fascinating as
a novel, but he has shown the romantic side
based upon knowledge of the most fragmentary
character. The writings which pass for history
were either written by bigoted priests who could
not see anything good in an idolatrous people,
and who, to please the leaders, painted the Aztecs
in blackest colours to justify the cruel
measures taken, or they were written by Spaniards
who never visited the country of which
they presumed to write. As it has been said,
“a most gorgeous superstructure of fancy has
been raised upon a very meagre foundation
of fact.” Their civilization was in many respects
marvellous and far ahead of that of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
other race on the western hemisphere. Under
the Montezumas they had grown into a powerful
nation, and their rule was one of barbaric
splendour and luxury.</p>

<p>The Aztecs succeeded an older race called the
Toltecs who were also far advanced in civilization.
They were nature worshippers and not
only did not indulge in human sacrifices, but
were averse to war and detested falsehood and
treachery. A Toltec noble is said to have instructed
his son after the following manner
before sending him away from home: “Never
tell a falsehood, because a lie is a grievous sin!
Speak ill of nobody. Be not dissolute, for
thereby thou wilt incense the gods, and they
will cover thee with infamy. Steal not, nor
give thyself up to gaming; otherwise thou wilt
be a disgrace to thy parents, whom thou oughtest
rather to honour, for the education they
have given thee. If thou wilt be virtuous, thy
example will put the wicked to shame.”</p>

<p>Both of these races were also great builders
and sculptors and had cultivated the art of
picture-writing. They were well housed, decently
clothed, made cloth, enjoyed vapour
baths, maintained schools, and had a large assortment
of household gods. They mined some,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and in agriculture, at least, were far ahead of
the Mexicans of to-day.</p>

<p>The vandalism of the Spaniards in destroying
the writings and other records of the early
races is rebuked by Prescott as follows: “We
contemplate with indignation the cruelties inflicted
by the early conquerors. But indignation
is qualified with contempt when we see
them thus ruthlessly trampling out the sparks
of knowledge, the common boon and property
of mankind. We may well doubt which has
the strongest claim to civilization, the victor or
the vanquished.”</p>

<p>The Mexico of to-day cannot be understood
without looking for a moment at its settlement
and the manner of the conquest. The Spanish
<i>conquistadores</i> who flocked to these shores with
Cortez were a different race from those early
settlers, who, persecuted and denied liberty of
conscience in the land of their birth, sought a
new home on our own hospitable shores. With
the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon
by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, and
the discovery of the New World, Spain had
suddenly leaped to the front, and become, for
a time at least, the greatest nation of the day.
Ships were constructed in great numbers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
sent out, filled with voyagers, “towards that
part of the horizon where the sun set.”</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century she had practically
become the mistress of the seas and the most
powerful nation in the world. Her soldiers
were brave and the acknowledged leaders of
chivalry, but the curse of the Spaniards was
their thirst for gold, and her decay was rapid.
When Cortez and his band of adventurers came
to the court of Montezuma, and saw the lavish
display of vessels and ornaments made of the
precious metal, they thought they had discovered
the land of gold for which they were
searching. Attracted by the glowing reports
of untold wealth, thousands of Spaniards soon
followed the first bands of <i>conquistadores</i>, and
they rapidly spread over the entire country occupied
by the Aztecs, ever searching for the
mines from whence this golden harvest came.
While the leaders were imprisoning and torturing
the Aztec chieftains to force them to
give up the hiding places of their treasures,
the priests, who everywhere accompanied the
soldiers, were baptizing thousands into the new
faith and using the confessional for the same
end. Thus religious bigotry and the mania for
worldly riches went side by side, and ever ringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in the ears of both priest and warrior was
the refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold!</div>
<div class="verse">Bright and yellow, hard and cold.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shortly after the conquest all the desirable
lands were parcelled out among the invaders
and the few Indian <i>caciques</i> who had helped,
with their powerful influence, in their subjugation.
The Spaniards rapidly pacified the
country, for the Aztec masses, however warlike
they may have been before the coming of the
Spaniards, were subdued by one blow. They
were soon convinced that opposition to the
power of Spain was useless. The priests, also,
through their quickly acquired influence, taught
submission to those whom God, in His infinite
wisdom, had placed over them. Chiefs who
would not yield otherwise were bribed to use
their power over their vassals in favour of the
Spaniards. Thus by force, bribery, intrigue,
diplomacy, treachery, and even religion, the
Indians were reconciled and the spirit of opposition
to the Spaniards broken. The result was
a new and upstart nobility who ruled the country
with an iron hand in the course of a few
decades; and the natives, with the exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the chiefs, were made vassals of these newly
made nobles.</p>

<p>An era of building followed, in which great
palaces after the <i>grandiose</i> ideas of Spain were
constructed by Indian workmen. Churches
were built with lavish hand, for these nobles
thought to atone for their many misdeeds by
constructing and dedicating places of worship
to Almighty God, who, according to the teaching
of the priest, was the God of the poor, oppressed
Indian as well as the God of the
haughty Spaniard who had enslaved him. As
one writer has said: “When John Smith and
his followers were looking for gold mines in
Virginia and the Pilgrims were planting corn in
Massachusetts, an empire had been founded
and built up on the same continent by the Spaniards,
and the most stupendous system of plunder
the world ever saw was then and there in
vigorous operation.” Cortez was searching for
“a people who had much gold” of which he
had heard. It was not God but gold that drew
him in his campaign over Mexico. He did not
aim to Christianize the natives so much as enrich
himself and acquire empire for his sovereign,
and religion was a subterfuge plausible
and popular in that age.</p>

<p>“I die,” said the patriot Hidalgo, when about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to be executed in 1811, “but the seeds of liberty
will be watered by my blood. The cause will
not die; that still lives and will surely triumph.”
His prediction came true, and freedom from
the Spanish yoke of three centuries was secured
ten years later after the shedding of much
blood. Peace did not follow at once, however,
for in the fifty years succeeding the declaration
of independence the form of government
changed ten times, and there were fifty-four
different rulers, including two emperors and
a number of dictatorships. Special privileges
are difficult to eradicate when established by
long usage, and those enjoying them yield only
to force. The Church, which had imposed on
the people such a vast number of priests, friars,
and nuns, and had acquired the most of the
wealth of the country, clung with the grip of
death to its privileges and property. The
changes came gradually, but it has been a half-century
since the Church and State were formally
separated by constitutional amendment.
The bigoted and despotic Romanism, which was
allied with the Spanish aristocracy, has at last
been subdued. A more tolerant spirit is springing
up towards other forms of religious faith
through the efforts of a powerful and liberal
government. Education is also freeing the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
from the superstitious ignorance which has
hitherto prevailed in most parts of Mexico.
There are occasional outbursts of fanaticism,
but they are quickly suppressed, and the government
is making an honest effort to preserve
freedom of worship to all faiths.</p>

<p>The United States of Mexico is a federation
composed of twenty-seven states, three territories,
and the federal district in which the capital
is located. The states are sovereign within
themselves and are held together under a federal
constitution very much like our own. This
constitution was adopted on the 5th of February,
1857, and its semi-centennial was recently
celebrated with a few of the original
signers present. There is a congress composed
of two bodies, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies
which meets twice each year. Each state
is represented in the former by two senators
and in the latter by one representative for
each forty thousand of population. The right
of suffrage is restricted so that only a small
proportion of the population can exercise that
privilege. They have not really reached popular
government, and politics, as we know them
in the United States, do not exist. A presidential
election scarcely caused a ripple on the surface.
President Diaz was no doubt the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
choice, but comparatively few votes were cast
at his last election. The rule of the Diaz
government although decidedly autocratic was
beneficient, and has redounded to the good of
the country. Though practically an absolute
ruler, President Diaz always acted through the
regularly organized channels of a complete form
of republican government, and outwardly, at
least, there was no semblance of a dictatorship.</p>

<p>Mexico is a country of great natural resources
and possibilities which have been only
partially developed. Its soil is remarkably fertile
and could support five times, and, if water
could be found on the plateaus, ten times the
present population. And I say this notwithstanding
the fact that one man has said that
Mexico is the poorest country south of Greenland,
and north of the south pole. The flora
of the country, among which are many useful
and medicinal plants, is exceedingly rich and
varied. More species of fibre plants are found
there than in any other country, and the commercial
utility of these plants is not yet fully
appreciated. In no country has there been
greater waste of natural resources than the
Spanish conquerors caused in Mexico. It is
as a mining country that Mexico has been best
known and the Mexican silver mines have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
famous ever since the discovery of the New
World, and they are still the greatest single
source of wealth. Some of them which have
been worked for centuries are still yielding
small fortunes in the white metal each year.</p>

<p>The Mexican has his own view of the United
States and does not call our boasted progress
and much-vaunted civilization, with its hurry,
brusque ways and the blotting out of the finer
courtesies, an improvement. He appreciates
our mechanical contrivances and electrical inventions,
but prefers to enjoy life after his own
fashion and in the way he thinks that God
intended in order to keep men happy. The
civilization received by Mexico in the sixteenth
century was looked upon as equal to the best
in existence, and to this was added an ancient
civilization found in the country. From these
sources a manner of living has been evolved
which bears evidences of culture and refinement.
This system has flowed on through the
intervening centuries, undisturbed by the
march of progress, until the last quarter of a
century. Things cannot be changed to Anglo-Saxon
standards in a year, or two years, or
even a generation. To Americanize Mexico
will be a difficult if not impossible undertaking,
and there are no signs of such a transition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Americans who live there fall into Mexican
ways and moral standards more frequently
than Mexicans are converted to the American
point of view. The influence of traditions, customs,
and climate, and the centuries-old habit
of letting the morrow take care of itself is too
great to be overcome.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">ACROSS THE PLATEAUS</span></h2>

<p>The traveller going to Mexico by rail will
discover that that country begins long before
the border is reached. While travelling over
the great state of Texas, where the dialect of
the natives is as broad as the rolling prairie
round about, he is reminded of our southern
neighbour by the soft accents of the Spanish
language, or by the entrance into the coach
of a Mexican cowboy with his great hat and
picturesque suit. Leaving beautiful San Antonio,
which is a Spanish city modernized, it is
but a few hours until the train crosses the
muddy Rio Grande at Laredo and, after passing
an imaginary line in the centre of the
stream, enters the land of burros and <i>sombreros</i>,
a land of mysterious origin and vast
antiquity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus5">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“THE LAND OF BURROS AND <i>SOMBREROS</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The custom officials are very polite and soon
affix the necessary label “despachado” to the
baggage. “<i>Vamonos</i>” (we go) replaces the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
familiar “all aboard,” and the train moves
out over a country as flat and dreary as a desert.
By whichever route the traveller enters
Mexico, the journey is very uninteresting for
the first half day. There is nothing to relieve
the monotony except the telephone and telegraph
poles, with their picturesque cross-arms
standing out on the desert waste like giant
sentinels. There is no vegetation except the
prickly pear, cactus, and feather duster palms,
for frequently no rain falls for years at a time.
It seems almost impossible that anything can
get moisture from the parched air of these
plains. But nature has strange ways of adapting
life to conditions. A good illustration of
this is seen in the <i>ixtle</i>, a species of cactus
whose leaves look as if they could not absorb
any moisture because of a hard varnish-like
coat. Whenever any water in the form of dew
or rain appears, however, this glaze softens
and the plant absorbs all the moisture available
and then glazes over again as soon as the sun
comes out.</p>

<p>There is very little life here. Sometimes at
the stations a few adobe huts are seen where
dwell the section hands, and a few goats are
visible which, no doubt, find the prickly pear
and cactus with an occasional railroad spike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
thrown in for variety, much more satisfying
than an unchanging diet of tin cans such as
falls to the lot of the city goat. The mountain
ranges then appear, and never is the traveller
out of sight of them in Mexico. On either side,
toward the east and toward the west, is a range
with an ever varying outline, sometimes near,
then far,—advancing and retreating. At a distance
in this clear atmosphere their rough features
are mellowed by a soft haze into amethyst
and purple; nearer they sometimes rise like a
camp of giants and are the most fantastic
mountains that earthquakes ever made in sport,
looking as if nature had laughed herself into
the convulsions in which they were formed.</p>

<p>The Mexican National Railway follows a
broad road that was formerly an Indian trail,
and the track crosses and recrosses this highway
many times. By this same route it is probable
that early Mexican races entered that
country and marched down toward the Valley
of Mexico. It was by this way that General
Taylor invaded the country during the Mexican
War and several engagements took place along
the line of this railroad.</p>

<p>The first town of any size is Monterey, capital
of the state of Nuevo Leon, the oldest and
one of the most important cities in Northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Mexico. It lies in a lovely valley with high hills
on every side. It is at a lower altitude than
the cities farther south on this line and enjoys
a salubrious climate. Monterey is a very much
Americanized town and has great smelters,
factories, and breweries, but it also boasts of
beautiful gardens and some old churches. The
Topo Chico hot springs only a few miles away
have a great reputation for healing. Here it
was, in 1846, that General Taylor overcame a
much superior force of the enemy under General
Ampudia in a desperate and stubbornly
disputed battle lasting several days, the contest
being hotly fought from street to street.
The Mexican troops entered the houses and
shot at the American soldiers from the windows
and roofs. It is now a city of more than
fifty thousand people.</p>

<p>Leaving Monterey, the road soon begins a
gradual ascent to the higher plateaus and
reaches the zone called <i>tierra fria</i>, or cold
country. This name would seem a misnomer
to one who hails from the land of snow and ice,
for the mean temperature of this “cold land”
is that of a perpetual spring such as is enjoyed
north of Mason and Dixon’s line. It is
properly applied to all that part of Mexico
which is six thousand feet or more above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
level of the sea and the greater part of the
immense central plateaus comes within this
designation. These plains which comprise
about two-thirds of the entire country, are
formed by the great Andes range of mountains
which separates into two great <i>cordillerias</i>
near Oaxaca and gradually grow farther and
farther apart as they approach the Rio Grande.
The western branch crowds the shore of the
Pacific and the eastern follows the coast line
of the Gulf of Mexico, but the latter keeps at
a greater distance from the sea, thus giving
a wider expanse of the hotlands. They are not
level tablelands, these <i>mesas</i>, as they always
slope in some direction. The arid condition
follows as a natural course, for the lofty ranges
cause the rain to be precipitated on the coast
lands except during certain seasons in the year
when the winds change. When the rains do
come, a miracle is wrought, and the sombre
landscape blossoms into a lively green dotted
with flowers. It is rare to find such great
plains at so high an altitude. Although now almost
barren of trees it is probable that in early
times these tablelands were covered with a
forest growth principally of oak and cypress.
This is evidenced by the few groves that yet
remain, in which many of the trees are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
extraordinary dimensions. The Spaniards completed
the spoliation that had been begun by
the earlier races.</p>

<p>Saltillo, the next important town, is the capital
of the State of Coahuila. It is interesting
to Americans, as just a few miles from here
and near the railway took place the battle of
Buena Vista, at the village of that name. Here
the Americans under General Taylor sent
double their number of Mexicans under the
notorious Santa Anna, flying on February
23rd, 1847.</p>

<p>Still climbing, the road continues toward the
capital, passes through a rich mining district,
and after the Tropic of Cancer is crossed the
traveller is in the Torrid Zone, the spot being
marked by a pyramid. Plains, seemingly endless,
where for a hundred miles the long stretch
of track is without a curve, are traversed, and
so dry that wells and water-tanks are objects
of interest. It is mostly given up to vast <i>haciendas</i>.
Some of these estates still remain in
the hands of the original families as granted at
the time of the conquest.</p>

<p>It was on these vast, seemingly barren plateaus
that the <i>hacienda</i> reached its highest
development. One does not go far south of
the Rio Grande before the significance of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
institution in Mexican life becomes apparent.
Sometimes when the train stops at a little
adobe station with a long name, the traveller
wonders what is the need of a station; for
there is no town and only a few native huts
clustered around the depot. However a glance
around the horizon will reveal the towers and
spire of a <i>hacienda</i> nestling at the foot of the
hills perhaps several miles away. In the olden
times they took the place of the feudal castles
of the middle ages in Europe and in these
sparsely settled regions they were especially
necessary. Within the high walls which often
surround them for protection were centralized
the residence of the owner and all of his employees
and the necessary buildings to store
the products of the soil. The <i>hacendado’s</i>
home was a large, roomy building, for, since
there were no inns, the traveller must be entertained
and hospitality was of the open-handed
sort. The travel-worn wayfarer was welcomed
and no questions asked. His wants were supplied
and at his departure the benediction
“Go, and God be with you,” followed him.
Even yet at some of these great <i>haciendas</i>,
where the old-time customs prevail, the bell
is rung at mealtime and any one who hears it
is welcomed at the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The term <i>hacienda</i> has a double meaning, for
it is applied both to the great estates and to
the buildings. It is a patriarchal existence
that is led by these landed proprietors. A
thousand peons and more are frequently attached
to the estate. Near the station of Villa
Reyes is a great <i>hacienda</i> which once controlled
twenty thousand peons. These must be provided
with homes, but a room fifteen feet
square is considered sufficient for a family,
no matter how large. Little furniture is
needed, for they live out of doors mostly, and
mats, which can be removed during the day,
take the place of cumbersome beds. The <i>administrador</i>,
who may be an Indian also, and
other heads, live better and are housed in
larger quarters. A church is always a part
of the estate and a priest must be kept to furnish
spiritual solace, as well as a doctor to
administer to those whose bodies are infirm.
Schools are also maintained by most of the
proprietors to-day. The peon must be provided
with his provisions each week and a little
patch of ground for his own use. Around the
buildings lie the cultivated fields, and from
early morn until the shades of night have fallen,
lines of burros are constantly passing in and
out laden with wood, corn, vegetables, poultry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
boxes of freight, and all the other items of
traffic which are a part of the life of this great
household.</p>

<p>After piercing another of the mountain
ranges which intersect the country from east
to west, and traversing miles of fertile fields
and gardens bearing semi-tropical fruits and
vegetables, the road enters a valley and the
city of San Luis Potosi is reached. Every
country has its Saint Louis, but only one has
a Saint Louis of the Treasure, and that is San
Luis Potosi, the capital of the state of that
name. It lies in a spreading plain of great fertility—made
so by irrigation—whose gardens
extend to the encircling hills that are rich
in the mineral treasures which give the city
its name. The San Pedro mines near here
alone produce an annual output of several millions.
These mines were revealed to Spaniards
by an Indian who had become converted to
Christianity. There is a mint here that coins
several millions of dollars each year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus6">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MARKET SCENE IN SAN LUIS POTOSI</p>
</div>

<p>San Luis Potosi is not a new city nor has
its growth been of the mushroom variety.
Founded in the middle of the sixteenth century,
it preserves to-day in wood and stone the spirit
of old Spain transplanted by the conquerors
to the new world. Drawn hither by the reports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of gold, the Spanish cavalier stalked through
the streets of this town in complete mail before
the <i>Mayflower</i> landed on the shores of Massachusetts.
The priests were chanting the solemn
service of the church here long before the
English landed at Jamestown. Dust had gathered
on the municipal library, which now contains
a hundred thousand volumes, centuries
before the building of the first little red school
house in the United States. Before New York
had been thought of, the drama of life was
being enacted here daily after Castillian models.</p>

<p>It is a cleanly city and the bright attractive
look of its houses is refreshing. A city ordinance
compels the citizens to keep up the appearance
of their houses, and the colours remind
one of Seville. It is pleasant to walk
along these streets and through the plazas with
their trees and flowers and fountains.</p>

<p>I will never forget my arrival in this city.
We reached there about midnight, having been
delayed by a wreck; and a number of <i>mozos</i>
pounced upon the party of Americans who had
been dropped by the belated train, each one
eager to carry some of the baggage. We were
marched through the Alameda, which, for a
wonder, adjoins the station, on walks shaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
by broad-leaved, tropical plants, down narrow
streets and around several corners to the hotel.
Arrived here it was only after several minutes
of vigorous knocking that a sleepy-looking
porter opened the door, and we entered the
hotel and walked down the hall through a line
of sleeping servants. The room finally assigned
to my friend and myself was thirty-four
feet long, sixteen feet wide and about twenty-five
feet high, and there were four great windows
extending nearly from ceiling to floor
and protected by heavy iron bars which made
them look like the windows of a prison. It had
doubtless been some church property at one
time, but whether monastery or convent I did
not learn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus7">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">COCK-FIGHTING IN MEXICO</p>
</div>

<p>Not all this city is pretty however, for distance
often lends enchantment, and a closer
scrutiny takes away much of this charm. I
saw filth on the streets here that can only be
duplicated in old Spain itself. There are numerous
churches and several of them are quite
pretentious and contain some fine paintings.
On the façade of one church there is a clock
presented by the king of Spain in return for
the largest piece of gold ever found in America.
San Luis is a thrifty city as Mexican towns go
and has numerous manufacturing establishments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
including a large smelting works, the
Compania Metallurgica, and is an important
railroad centre. It is distant from the City
of Mexico three hundred and sixty-two miles,
and has a population of seventy thousand souls.</p>

<p>This city claims quite a number of American
families as residents and many of the storekeepers
have been somewhat Americanized, for
they actually seem to be on the lookout for business.
The state capitol is a very interesting
building. While looking through this palace
I saw the “line up” of petty offenders who
were being sent out to sweep the streets. They
were the worst looking lot of <i>pulque</i>-drinkers
I ever saw and were clothed in rags. Each one
was given a handful of twigs with which he was
obliged to sweep the streets and gutters, and
they were sent out in gangs, each under a police
officer. The vices of these people are generally
more evident than their virtues. They are inveterate
gamblers. Wherever one goes (not
alone in San Luis Potosi) fighting cocks are
encountered tied by the leg to a stake with a
few feet of string. Or they may be carried
in the arms of young would-be sports who brag
of their birds to any one who will listen. One
day I saw a man with a cock whose head was
one bloody-looking mass. He had just cut off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the rooster’s comb. When I stopped and
looked, the Indian laughed as though it were
a great joke and said he was “much sick.”
This was done so that in a fight his opponent
could not catch hold of the comb. Itinerant
cock-fighters who travel across the country
carrying their birds in hollow straw tubes are
popular fellows.</p>

<p>Leaving San Luis Potosi at noontime the
traveller catches his last glimpse of this city
where</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Upon the whitened city walls</div>
<div class="verse">The golden sunshine softly falls,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The train soon enters a rich agricultural belt
and the country becomes more populous. Giant
cacti towering straight and tall to a height of
fifteen or twenty feet are a common sight.</p>

<p>Dolores Hidalgo where the patriot-priest
first sounded the call to liberty and revolution
is passed. Then comes Querétero, which occupies
a prominent place in Mexican history and
is the last city of any size on the way to the
capital. Here the treaty of peace between Mexico
and the United States was negotiated. In
this city Maximilian played the last act in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
tragedy of the empire. He was captured while
attempting to escape on June 19th, 1867, and
was shot on the Cerro de las Campañas, a little
hill just outside the city. With him were shot
Generals Miramon and Mejia. Maximilian died
with the cry of “<i>Viva Mexico</i>” on his lips.
There is a magnificent aqueduct here which,
because of the high arches, looks like the old
ruined aqueduct seen on approaching Rome.
The tallest arch is nearly one hundred feet.
The entire length of the aqueduct is about five
miles and it is still in use. There are a number
of factories for cotton goods. Among them
is the great Hercules Mill which employs more
than two thousand hands. The grounds are
laid out in elaborate and beautiful style.</p>

<p>After climbing the mountain range again
until an altitude of nearly ten thousand feet
has been reached, the descent begins and the
beauty of the Valley of Mexico unfolds. Fleeting
glimpses of the scene may be caught
through little gaps in the mountains until
finally the train enters a pass and the traveller
has his first view of the City of Mexico. Beyond
the glittering towers and domes of the
modern city on the site of the ancient Aztec
capital lies the bright expanse of the lakes, and
still further in the distance is seen the encircling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
girdle of mountains like a protecting wall
around this enchanted scene.</p>

<p>There are many other cities situated on these
vast plateaus, for the <i>tierra fria</i> has always
maintained the bulk of the population in spite
of the extraordinary richness of the lowlands.
They are growing in size as manufacturing establishments
become more numerous. A number
of them like Chihuahua, Aguas Calientes,
Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Durango, and Leon are
interesting cities of from thirty to forty thousand
inhabitants and all of them are old. Chihuahua
(pronounced Che-wa-wa) is the capital
of the state of that name which is the largest
state in the republic and is twice as large as
the state of Ohio. It has a population of less
than four hundred thousand. This will serve
to give a little idea of the vastness of these
great tablelands and the sparseness of population.
It is chiefly devoted to great ranches
where hundreds of thousands of cattle are
grazed.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note that cattle
ranching originated in this state. All the terms
used on the range and roundup are of Spanish
origin and are the same that have been employed
for centuries. One man here is the
owner of a cattle ranch covering seventeen million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
acres. The traveller might journey for
days and cross ranges of mountains and not
pass beyond his princely domain. There are a
number of cattle ranches of from one to two
million acres and a few Americans are now
entering the field here since the public domain
in the United States has dwindled so much.</p>

<p>Two cities, Guadalajara and Puebla, have
long disputed for the honour of second city in
the republic. Puebla is situated southeast of
the capital and is a city of tiles, for tiles are
used everywhere from the domes of churches
to floors for the devout to kneel upon. It is the
capital of the richest state in the republic and
has probably seen more of the vicissitudes of
war than any other city. It has been captured
and occupied successively by Spaniards, Americans
and French and by revolutionists times
without number. This city was the scene of
General Zaragossa’s victory on May 5th, 1862,
when he repulsed the French forces just outside
the city’s gates. This victory is celebrated
each year as the “<i>cinco de Mayo</i>” (Fifth of
May) and is the great anti-foreign day. Formerly
foreigners did not show themselves on
the street on this day, but that antagonistic
sentiment has disappeared. In 1906 because
of labour disturbances for which American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
agitators were blamed trouble was feared on
this day, but it passed off without an unpleasant
incident. This city was founded as early
as 1532. Its history is romantic and full of
legends recounting the many visits of the
angels. Angels appeared one night and staked
out the city. Again, while the cathedral was
being built, the angels came after nightfall
when the city was wrapped in slumber and
built a great part of the tower. At another
time the angels were marshalled in mighty
hosts just over the city. The people can even
point out to you the very places where the
angelic visitors roosted. The ecclesiastical
records vouch for these appearances of the
heavenly visitors and the people devoutly believe
in them.</p>

<p>Puebla has wide streets—for Mexico—and
many beautiful plazas with flowers and fountains.
It is also noted for its bull-fights and
has two bull-rings. These are in use nearly
every Sunday and frequently for the benefit
of or in honour of some church feast or departed
saint. The public buildings are very
creditable and the city contains good schools
and hospitals. A goodly number of foreigners
live here, especially Germans. I have noticed
that the Germans affiliate with the Mexicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
much better than Americans generally do. One
reason is that they come here to establish their
permanent residence, while Americans, like
the Chinese, desire to make their fortunes and
then return to the land of their birth to spend
their later days.</p>

<p>Puebla has become quite a manufacturing
city and especially of cotton goods, paper, flour
and soaps. Onyx and marble are quarried near
here, and a large number of workmen are employed
in the quarries and in the establishments
preparing these materials for the market.
Several railroads now reach this city, and
its importance as an industrial centre is increasing
each year.</p>

<p>All kinds of grains that are produced in the
temperate zones will grow on the tablelands
of Mexico wherever there is sufficient rain or
water to be obtained by irrigation. A constantly
increasing amount of acreage is being
made available through the extension of the
irrigation system, but its possibilities are only
beginning to be realized. Corn, which is such
a great article of food with the Mexicans, is
by far the most valuable agricultural product
and several hundred million bushels are produced
each year. Wheat was first introduced
in Mexico by a monk who planted a few grains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that he had brought with him. This grain is
now raised quite extensively in some districts
but frequently there is not enough for even
local consumption. Cotton is also produced
in a number of the states.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;" id="illus8">

<p class="caption">THE <i>MAGUEY</i></p>
</div>

<p>Mexico is especially rich in fibre-producing
plants and no country in the world has so many
different varieties. All of these belong to the
great cactus, or <i>agave</i>, family. The value of
the cactus has never been fully appreciated but
new uses are being found for it constantly, and
new kinds with valuable qualities are being discovered
in Mexico almost yearly. Perhaps the
most valuable plant of this family that is being
cultivated in Mexico to-day is that species of
the <i>agave</i> that produces the valuable henequen
fibre of commerce. This plant very much resembles
the <i>maguey</i> and grows on the thin,
rocky, limestone soil of Yucatan. From this
fibre is made most of the binder twine and much
of the rope used in the United States. It has
the threefold qualities of strength, pliability
and colour. In the past twenty years the cultivation
of henequen has grown to enormous
proportions, and some of the planters have become
millionaires almost rivalling the famous
bonanza kings of olden times. The amount of
henequen, or sisal, fibre exported to the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
States from 1880 to 1905 was nine million, two
hundred and nineteen thousand, two hundred
and fifteen bales at an estimated value of $300,988,072.66.
In 1902 the exports reached a maximum,
and amounted to $34,185,275. All of this
fibre is exported through the port of Progreso.</p>

<p>Several species of the cactus family are being
experimented with, and it is claimed that they
will produce an excellent quality of paper pulp.
This may help to solve the problem that now
bothers paper manufacturers as the forests of
spruce disappear before the woodsman’s ax.
The graceful <i>maguey</i>, the <i>agave americana</i>, is
cultivated almost everywhere on the plateau
lands. It also produces a valuable fibre, but
this plant is not cultivated primarily for that
purpose. The ancient races used the thorns
for pins and needles; the leaves furnished a
kind of parchment for their writings and thatch
for their roofs; and the juice when fermented
made a—to them—most delicious drink. On
the plains of Apam just east of the Valley of
Mexico and north of Puebla the cultivation of
the <i>maguey</i> has reached the highest development.</p>

that at least her descendants will have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
pleasure of seeing it blossom at the end of a
hundred years, would be surprised to see the
immense plantations consisting of thousands of
this same plant growing here. The plant, commonly
called the <i>maguey</i>, is a native of Mexico
and grows to great size. It flourishes best in
rocky and sandy soil and is quite imposing in
appearance. Its dark green, spiked leaves
which lift themselves up and spread out in
graceful curves, sometimes reach a length of
fifteen feet, and are a foot in breadth and several
inches thick. It requires from six to ten
years for the <i>maguey</i> to mature on its native
heath. When that period arrives a slender
stalk springs up from the centre of these great
leaves, twenty to thirty feet high, upon which
a great mass of small flowers is clustered. This
supreme effort exhausts the plant and, its duty
to nature having been performed, it withers
and dies.</p>

<p>This is not the purpose for which the <i>maguey</i>
is raised on the big plantations where the rows
of graceful century plants stretch out as far as
the eye can reach in unwavering regularity.
On these plantations the <i>maguey</i> is not permitted
to flower. The Indians know, by infallible
signs, almost the very hour at which it
is ready to send up the central stalk, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
then marked by an overseer with a cross. The
stalk is now full of the sap which is the object
of its culture. Other Indians follow up the
overseer and, making an incision at the base
of the plant, extract the central portion, leaving
only the rind which forms a natural basin.
Into this the sap, which is called <i>agua miel</i>, or
honey-water, and which is almost as clear as
water and as sweet as honey, collects. So
quickly does this fluid gather that it is found
necessary to remove it two or three times per
day. The method of gathering this sap is extremely
primitive. The Indian is provided
with a long gourd at the lower end of which
is a horn. He places the small end, which is
open, in the liquid and, applying his lips to an
opening in the large end, sucks the sap up into
the gourd. The sap is then emptied into a receptacle
swung across his back which is made
of a whole goat-skin or pig-skin with the hair
on the inside. The <i>maguey</i> plant will yield six
or more quarts of this “honey-water” in a
day and the supply will continue from one to
three months. It is then exhausted and withers
and decays. However, a new shoot will spring
up from the old roots without replanting.</p>

<p>This innocent looking and savoury sap is
then taken to a building prepared for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and there poured into vats made of cowhides
stretched on a frame. In each vat a little
sour liquor called “mother of <i>pulque</i>” has
been poured. This causes quick fermentation
and in a few hours the <i>pulque</i> of the Mexican is
ready for the market. It is at its best after
about twenty-four hours fermentation. It then
has somewhat the appearance and taste of stale
buttermilk and a rancid smell. After more
fermentation it has the odour of putrid meat.
The skins in which it is carried increase this
disagreeable odour. The first taste of <i>pulque</i>
to a stranger is repellant. However, it is said
that, contrary to the general rule, familiarity
breeds a liking. Great virtues are claimed for
it in certain ailments and it is said to be wholesome.
However this is not the reason why the
peons drink <i>pulque</i> in such great quantities.
Several special trainloads go in each day to the
City of Mexico over one road, besides large
amounts over other routes and it is a great
revenue producer for the railroads. The daily
expenditure for <i>pulque</i> in the City of Mexico
alone is said to exceed twenty thousand dollars.
Physicians say that the brain is softened, digestion
ruined and nerves paralyzed by a too generous
use of this liquor. Many employers of
labour will not employ labourers from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<i>pulque</i> districts if they can possibly get them
from other sources. <i>Tequila</i> and <i>Mescal</i> are
two forms of ardent spirits distilled from a
juice yielded by the leaves and root of the
<i>maguey</i>. They are forms of brandy that it is
best for the traveller to leave alone.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CAPITAL</span></h2>

<p>The City of Mexico represents progressive
Mexico. In it is concentrated the wealth, culture
and refinement of the republic. It is the
political, the educational, the social and the
commercial centre of the whole country. It is
to Mexico what Paris is to France. In fact
it would be Mexico as Paris would be France.
The same glare and glitter of a pleasure-loving
metropolis are found here, and within the same
boundaries may be seen the deepest poverty
and most abject degradation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;" id="illus9">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="575" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MAP OF THE VALLEY OF MEXICO</p>
</div>

<p>“Wait until you get to the City of Mexico,”
said an educated Mexican to me as we were
crossing the sparsely-settled tablelands of
northern Mexico, where the only inhabitants
are Indians. The Mexicans are proud of their
city and are pleased to have it likened to the
gay French capital, for their ideals and tastes
are fashioned after the Latin standard rather
than the American. The French, they say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
have the culture and can embrace <i>a la Mexicana</i>,
which is done by throwing an arm around
a friend whom they meet and patting him
heartily on the back. They prefer the easy-going,
wait-a-while style of existence to the
hurried, strenuous life of an American city.
No people love leisure and the pursuit of pleasure
more than our neighbours in the Mexican
metropolis. They work during the morning
hours, take a noon <i>siesta</i>, close up early in the
afternoon and are ready for pleasure in the
evening until a late hour.</p>

<p>In appearance the capital resembles Madrid
more than any other city I have ever seen.
The architecture is the Moorish-Spanish style,
into which some Aztec modifications have been
wrought by the new-world builders. The light,
airy appearance of an American city is absent
for there are no frame structures anywhere.
The square, flat-roofed buildings, with walls
thick enough to withstand any earthquake
shock, are two or three stories in height and
built round a <i>patio</i>, or courtyard, the centre
of which is open to the sky. The old architects
were not hampered by such paltry considerations
as the price of lots, and so they built
veritable palaces with wide corridors and rooms
lofty and huge. Through many of these rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
you might easily drive a carriage. There are
parlours as large as public halls, and throughout
all one notes the <i>grandiose</i> ideas of the
race. The houses, of stone or brick covered
with stucco, are built clear up to the sidewalk
so that there is no tinge of green in front. The
Mexican is not particular about the exterior
of his home, but expends his thought and money
on the open court within. The plainness of the
outside is relieved only by the large gate, or
door, which is also the carriage drive-way, and
the neat little, iron-grated balconies on which
the windows open from the upper stories.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus10">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE PATIO OF AN OLD RESIDENCE</p>
</div>

<p>These balconies afford a convenient place for
the women of the household to see what is passing
on the street, and also for the <i>señorita</i>, or
young lady, to watch the restless pacing to and
fro of the love-stricken youth who is “playing
bear” in front of the house. The great doorway,
which is carefully barred and bolted at
night, and strictly guarded by the porter during
the day, is the only entrance to the <i>patio</i>, which,
in the better class of homes, is adorned with
pretty gardens, statuary and fountains. Many
of them contain an open plunge bath. Through
the wide windows one catches glimpses of fascinating
interiors, and through the broad doorways
the passer-by on the street gets many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pretty view of the courtyards, and of these
miniature gardens. One or two rows of living-apartments
extend around and above the court,
with broad corridors in front handsomely
paved with tile, protected by balustrades and
adorned with flowers and vines. Above, the
red tiles of the roof add a little additional colour
to the scene. There are no cellars nor
chimneys. The latter were never introduced
because of the mildness of the climate. In the
courts protected from the winds, the people
keep on the sunny side when it is cool and hide
from the same orb when it is hot. Charcoal
fires are used for cooking and heat when it becomes
necessary. Cellars are made impossible
because of the marshy nature of the soil.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that Tenochtitlan, the Aztec
capital, has been called the New World
Venice, whose streets were once canals. It
must have been a gay and picturesque scene
when the fair surface of its waters was resplendent
with shining cities and flowering
islets. The waters have since receded until
Lake Texcoco, at its nearest point, is three
miles distant. Mexico is now a more prosaic
city of streets and cross-streets which extend
from north to south and from east to west.
Some of the principal thoroughfares are broad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
paved with asphalt and well kept; but many
are quite narrow, and especially is this true
of the streets called lanes, though devoted to
business. There is no exclusive residence section,
except in the new additions, and many of
the homes of the old families are found sandwiched
in between stores. It is a difficult matter
to become familiar with the names of the
streets, for they are more than nine hundred
in number, and a street generally has a different
name for each block. If several blocks have
the same name, as, for instance, Calle de San
Francisco, one of the finest streets, and on or
near which are some of the largest hotels, finest
stores and richest private dwellings, then it
is First San Francisco, Second San Francisco,
etc.</p>

<p>A few years ago the streets were re-named.
All the streets extending east and west were
called <i>avenidas</i>, and the north and south streets
<i>calles</i>, each continuous thoroughfare being
given but one name. The people, however, in
this land of legend and tradition, clung so tenaciously
to the former designations that they
have practically been restored. Some of the
old names of streets commemorated historical
events, as, for instance, the Street of the <i>Cinco
de Mayo</i>, which is in remembrance of the victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the Mexicans over the French at Puebla
in 1862. Others are named in honour of men
noted in the history of Mexico. Many religious
terms appear, such as the street of Jesus,
Sanctified Virgin, Holy Ghost, Sepulchres of
the Holy Sabbath, and the like. Others owe
their names to some incident or legend, which
is both interesting and mysterious. Of the
latter class may be mentioned the Street of the
Sad Indian, Lane of Pass if You Can, Street
of the Lost Child, Street of the Wood Owls,
Lane of the Rat, Bridge of the Raven and
Street of the Walking Priest. The Street of
the Coffin Makers is now known as the Street
of Death. It is a thoroughfare of one block,
and is one of the few streets that still preserves
its ancient caste, for it is devoted exclusively
to the makers of coffins. All of the coffins are
made by hand. It is a gloomy street and there
are cleaner spots on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Mexico is a very cosmopolitan city. Its three
hundred and seventy-five thousand inhabitants
include representatives from nearly every nation
of the earth. The Indians are vastly in
the majority, and they are the pure and original
Mexicans. The Creoles, who are descendants
of Europeans, generally Spanish, call
themselves the Mexicans and rank second in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
number. They form the real aristocratic body
from whom come the representative Mexicans.
They are not all dark, but a blonde is a rare
specimen. Most of them have an olive-brown
colour, thus showing the mixture of Indian
blood, for in early days it was not considered
a <i>mesalliance</i> for even a Spanish officer of high
rank to marry an Aztec maiden of the better
class.</p>

<p>The old families cling tenaciously to the
great estates, or <i>haciendas</i>, many of which have
remained intact for centuries. Quite a number
can even trace their estates back to the original
grants from the king of Spain. Many of these
<i>hacendados</i>, or landed proprietors, enjoy
princely incomes from their lands, and nearly
all of them own residences in the capital. They
maintain elaborate establishments and keep
four times as many servants as would be found
in an American house.</p>

<p>The average Mexican does not care for business.
Neither is he an inventor or originator,
for he is content to live as his ancestors have
lived. Nearly all lines of commerce and industry
are in the hands of foreigners. The Germans
monopolize the hardware trade; the
French conduct nearly all the dry goods stores;
the Spaniards are the country’s grocers; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the Americans and English control the railroad,
electric and mining industries. All these
interests centre in the City of Mexico. Railroads
are not very numerous until you approach
the Valley of Mexico where they converge
from all directions. The hum of industry
is apparent here as nowhere else in the
whole republic. The Mexicans boast of their
capital, but they often forget the debt they owe
to foreigners, for all the modern improvements
have been installed by alien races and outside
capital. It is another foreign invasion but with
a pacific mission. The American colony alone
in that city numbers more than six thousand
persons, and the number is constantly increasing.
Hatred of the American has almost disappeared,
and the incomers are cordially welcomed.
There are two flourishing clubs around
which the social life of the expatriated Americans
centre.</p>

<p>The society of the capital, and indeed of the
whole country, is very diverse. What might be
said of one class would not apply to another.
The differences of dress and customs alone
make known the heterogeneousness of the population.
They all use the same language and all
classes are brought together on a common level
in their religion. No other nation has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
made such complete conquests as Spain. She
not only subjugated the lands but forced her
language, as well as religion, upon the conquered
races. The English have succeeded in
extending their sway over a large part of the
world, but in no instance have they been able to
accomplish these two results with the native
population. The priests of Spain went hand
in hand with the <i>conquistadores</i>, and, within a
few generations after the conquest of Mexico
by Cortez, the Spanish language was universally
used and the Indians were at least nominal
Catholics.</p>

<p>The climate of the City of Mexico is delightful.
It is neither hot nor cold. It is too far
south to be cold and the altitude, seven thousand,
four hundred and thirty-four feet above
the level of the sea, is too great to be hot. The
temperature usually ranges from sixty-five to
eighty-five, but sometimes goes as high as
ninety, and as low as thirty-five, and frosts
occasionally are experienced. The mornings
and evenings are cool and at midday it is always
hot. There is a great difference in the
temperature between the sunny and shady side
of the street. Only dogs and Americans take
the sunny side, the Mexicans say. The rainy
and dry seasons occur with great regularity, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
former lasting from May to October. It is the
best season in the year although most visitors
go there in winter. The rains always occur in
the afternoon and usually cease before dark.
At this time, too, all nature takes on a beautiful
shade of green which replaces the rather dull
landscape of the dry season. There is also a
brisk, electric condition of the atmosphere that
is decidedly exhilarating and a good tonic.</p>

<p>This mildness of climate has greatly influenced
the life of the capital. The streets, except
during the noon <i>siesta</i>, are full of people
at all times. To judge from the crowds, one
might think the capital a city of a million people.
In the morning the women go to mass
garbed in black, generally wearing a black
shawl over the head. Occasionally a black lace
mantilla is seen half-concealing, half-exposing
the olive-brown face, and bright, sparkling eyes
of a <i>señorita</i>. Shoppers are out and business
is active. The women of the wealthier classes
sit in their carriages and have the goods
brought out to them, or go to a private room
where articles are exhibited by clerks. They
think that it is unbecoming to stand at the
counters, although the American plan of shopping
is becoming quite popular in recent years.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon the crowds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
again appear, and a little later the streets
begin to fill with carriages. Nowhere, not even
in Paris, have I observed so many carriages as
can be seen here on any pleasant afternoon.
They form one continuous, slow-moving line of
many miles. The procession moves out San
Francisco Street through the Alameda, along
the Paseo de la Reforma, and then into the
beautiful park surrounding the Castle of Chapultepec
which is set with great cypresses, said
to antedate the conquest. The cavalcade winds
around through the various drives at the base
of the rock, along the shores of the lake, past
the castle and back to the city. The carriages
go out on one side and return on the other,
leaving the central portion for riders. It is a
sight that never wearies for one to sit on a
bench and watch the motley throng of people
driving, riding on horseback and promenading.
An oriental exclusiveness is observed by ladies
of the upper class who always ride in closed carriages.
All kinds of vehicles are to be seen,
from fine equipages with liveried drivers and
footmen, to the poorest cab in the city with its
disreputable driver and broken-down horses,
fit only for the bull-ring.</p>

<p>There are many horsemen and the Mexicans
are always excellent riders. Their horses are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Lilliputian in size but fast and enduring. The
saddle, bridle and trappings are frequently
gorgeous with their silver ornaments and immense
stirrups fancifully worked and shaped.
The rider is often a picture wonderful to behold
from the heavy silver spurs which he wears,
to the sombrero of brown or yellow felt with
a brim ten to fifteen inches wide and a crown
equally as high, the whole covered with heavy
gilt cord formed into a sort of rope. Then
there is the dude or fop, who is well named in
Mexico. He is called a “<i>lajartija</i>” which
means a “little lizard.” He used to dress in
such close-fitting and stiff costumes that he had
not much more freedom of motion than the
stiff little lizard. Now he is the dandy who is
generally seen standing on a public corner,
wearing a French cutaway suit, American
patent leather shoes and an English stovepipe
hat, with his fingers closed over the indispensable
cigarette.</p>

<p>In the evening the populace attend the theatre
or some social function. Sunday is the day
of all others for recreation, and, with the average
inhabitant of Mexico, is one continuous and
eternal round of pleasure. After morning
service the entire day is devoted to pleasure.
Band concerts are always given by the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
bands on the Plaza in the morning, in the Alameda
early in the afternoon, and at Chapultepec
about five o’clock. Then there is the bull-fight
which occurs only on Sundays and holidays.</p>

<p>The average crowd in the City of Mexico is
a good natured and peaceable one. The city
Indian and his country cousin, the peon from
the plantation, join the crowd on a feast day
with their numerous progeny. They are not
the pleasantest neighbours in the world for
both have the odour of garlic and <i>pulque</i> and
their baths are of the annual variety. That
the little brown man is a peon is no fault of
his. His uncleanliness is, in a measure, the
result of centuries of neglect, and more particularly
of a scarcity of water at his home.
It is possible that if he had the water his condition
would be just the same. Though he is
poor and down-trodden, there is nothing of the
anarchist about him. He is absolutely devoid
of envy or malice; and withal his spirits are
gay and he is as generous to his family or
friends as his finances permit. The artificial
refinements of modern civilization have not yet
spoiled him, and there is a pleasant, even if
malodorous, naturalness about him.</p>

<p>In no city do ancient and modern customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
come into such intimate contrast as in the City
of Mexico. Nowhere is a greater mixture of
races to be seen than here. There are many
tribes of Indians speaking scores of dialects,
and there are <i>mestizos</i> of various degrees of
mixture with African, American and European
blood. Types of four centuries can be seen in
any group on one of the plazas. The Plaza
Mayor is a great, imposing, central square of
fourteen acres in the centre of the city, and
on its walks all the types can be seen at their
best. Men and women come into the city
through the streets lighted by electricity, bearing
immense loads on their heads and backs
rather than use a wagon. Peddlers carry
around jars of water for sale just as in the
olden times. Indians, who are almost pure
Aztecs, pass along, taking the middle of the
street in Indian file. Well dressed men in black
broadcloth suits and wearing silk hats go by.
The women of the middle class add colour to
the scene with the red and blue <i>rebosas</i>, sometimes
covering the head, or tied across the chest
and holding an infant at the back. Nearly all
the passers-by show in their colour that they
can claim kinship with the hosts of Montezuma.
The general effect is kaleidoscopic but entertaining.
The great cathedral on the north side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the Plaza is the one place where all are
brought together and class distinction obliterated.
Visit the cathedral any day and you
may see an Indian with his pack on his back
side by side with a young woman who may
inherit a dozen titles. There are no select,
high-priced, aristocratic pews for rent, but all
meet by a common genuflection before the sacred
altars. The poor Indian may not understand
all the pomp and ceremony, the music
of the vested choirs, or the solemn chanting by
the priests, but it fills a deep want in his nature
and he is satisfied.</p>

<p>At one side of the Plaza Mayor once stood
the great Aztec <i>Teocalli</i>, the Temple of Sacrifice.
This was a high imposing altar reached
by a flight of more than a hundred steps. From
the top was a magnificent view of the entire
valley, and it was from this point that the envious
eyes of Cortez looked out upon this beautiful
scene. The altar was dedicated to the
Aztec war god Huitzilopochtli, and here, to appease
the wrath of this terrible god, human sacrifices
were offered. The breast was cut open
and the heart, still palpitating, plucked out and
placed upon the altar. The bodies were cast
down to the ground, whence they were taken
and prepared for the banquet table.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus11">

<p class="caption">THE CATHEDRAL</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>A part of the space once covered by this
gruesome but majestic pile, is now occupied
by the Monte de Piedad, or “mountain of
mercy,” one of the most unique charities in
the world. It is nothing more or less than a
gigantic pawn-shop, but it is one of the most
beneficient institutions in the country. The
Count of Regla, a noted personage in Mexico,
founded this institution by a gift of three hundred
thousand dollars. He did this in order
that the poor and needy, and the impoverished
members of families once genteel, might secure
small sums upon personal property at low rates
of interest, instead of becoming involved in the
meshes of the blood-sucking vampires who prey
upon this class of unfortunates. About three-fourths
of the actual value of the property
pledged as fixed by appraisers, will be loaned.
If the interest is not paid, the property is kept
for seven months, when it is offered for sale
at a fixed price. If not disposed of in another
five months it is sold at auction.</p>

<p>The truly remarkable feature of this establishment
is, that if a greater sum is realized
than the amount of the loan and interest, the
excess is placed to the credit of the owner, or
his heirs, and will be kept for one hundred
years, after which time it reverts to the institution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Many old heirlooms of former grandees,
Aztec curios, diamonds, gold ornaments
and even family gods have passed through this
organization of charity. For more than a century
it has existed, having survived all the civil
wars, revolutions and changes of government.
The original capital has been more than
doubled by the forfeitures, and many branches
of this parent institution are operated in the
capital and in several of the large cities of the
republic. It is an example that might be suggested
to some of our multi-millionaires who
do not know what to do with their vast accumulations
of wealth.</p>

<p>Even the funerals are conducted in a strange
way. With the exception of funerals among
the wealthy, the street cars are universally
used. The enterprising owner of the street car
system some years ago acting on the trust idea,
bought up all the hearses and introduced funeral
cars. After a short time the people
became accustomed to the new plan, which
seemed to give satisfaction. Now, trolley
funeral cars of the first, second and third class
are furnished at a price varying from five dollars
for the cheapest class, to a hundred dollars
or more for a first-class car. Some of the poor
rent coffins which are returned after the burial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
The very poor may be seen carrying their dead
on their shoulders to the <i>Campo Santo</i>, or holy
ground. Graves are usually sold only for a
certain number of years, after which, unless
the relatives pay the prescribed fee, the bones
are taken up and the ground made ready for a
new occupant. The dead are soon forgotten.
A pile of bones in a corner of the cemetery
represents all that is mortal of the generations
who passed away not many years ago. There
is an entire lack of reverence for the mortal
remains of the departed, such as one is accustomed
to find in our own country. One is reminded
of the couplet</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rattle his bones over the stones,</div>
<div class="verse">He’s only a pauper, whom nobody owns.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The City of Mexico is not the healthiest city
in the world. On the contrary the death rate
is unusually high. The average duration of
life is said to be only twenty-six years. This
is due in a great measure to infant mortality.
Typhoid and malarial fevers are prevalent because
of the accumulated drainage of centuries,
which lies just a few feet beneath the surface.
Pneumonia is common and regarded as very
dangerous because of the rarefied air, and patients
suffering from this disease are immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
transported to lower altitudes for treatment.
The entire lack of hygiene and sanitary
conditions among the peon classes is in a great
measure responsible for the unusual percentage
of mortality. Few other cities in the world
have such a high rate of deaths compared with
the population.</p>

<p>Strange it is that the capital was ever built
on this low, marshy soil when higher land was
available and near at hand. It was one of the
great blunders of Cortez, for Mexico might
have been made a healthy city. No exigency
of commerce dictated its selection, for it is far
from the sea coast on either side and was difficult
of access before the day of railroads.
The new city was built on the site of the old,
and the temples of the Christian religion were
raised on the sites of the old pagan altars wherever
possible. A plan of moving the city to
higher ground was strongly agitated at one
time but the vested interests succeeded in killing
this project. It is hoped and believed that
when the plans for sewerage are completed, the
health conditions will be placed on a par with
that of most cities. The authorities are making
an honest and earnest effort to carry out these
commendable projects.</p>

<p>Thus sings the lower class Mexican to whom
this liquor has become a curse. To it is due
much of his poverty and many of his crimes.
For it he will neglect his family and steal from
his employer. It does not contain a large percentage
of alcohol, but, taken in large quantities,
as is customary among these people, it
puts them in a dopy condition which they sleep
off. One railroad brings in a train-load each
day, and, besides, large quantities are brought
in by other lines. There are sixteen hundred
pulque saloons in the capital, but they are all
closed at six o’clock by a law which is strictly
enforced. The pulque-shop betrays itself by
its odour, as well as by the crowds of poorly
dressed and even filthy men and women who
surround its doors and press around the counter.
It is a gaily decorated affair and is oftentimes
adorned in flaring colours inside and out,
with reds, blues, greens and yellows predominating,
and frequently with a huge, rude painting
on the outside walls. In some of the shops
you will find a curious string knotted in a peculiar
manner or strung with shells. This is a survival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the Aztec method of counting by means
of beads, or shells, strung together.</p>

<p>As one writer says, “the pulque shop, notwithstanding
its evil influence upon the life of
the people, presents a very picturesque appearance
to the tourist who has never seen anything
like it before. The dress of the people, the
curious, vivid colours of the walls of the building,
the semi-barbaric appearance of the decorations
within, the curious semi-symbolic pictures
upon the walls, the unaccustomed groupings
of the people, all combine to attract the
attention of the stranger in Mexico.”</p>

<p class="caption">A PICTURESQUE PULQUE SHOP</p>
</div>

<p>In the naming of the pulque-dens the imagination
is allowed full play. I quote from a
Mexican periodical the names of some of these
resorts: A place in the suburbs of Mexico is
termed the “Delight of Bacchus.” One is
called “The Seventh Heaven,” another “The
Food of the Gods,” while still another bears
the euphonious title of “The Land of the Lotus.”
“A Night of Delight” is another place
near “The Heart’s Desire.” The above names
are commonplace by the side of the following:
“The Hang-out of John the Baptist,” “The
Retreat of the Holy Ghost,” “The Delight of
the Apostle,” “The Retreat of the Holy Virgin,”
“The Mecca of Delight,” and “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Fountain of the Angels.” Nothing disrespectful
is intended by these appellations but they
sound very sacrilegious to us.</p>

<p>There is, however, a brighter side to the Indian
life in the City of Mexico. In one corner
of the Zocalo, and covering a part of the site
formerly occupied by the great sacrificial altar,
is the flower-market. This flower-market is
always attractive and a never-ending source
of interest to the tourist. Immense bouquets
of the choicest flowers are sold so cheap that
the price seems almost absurd. By judicious
bargaining a few cents will purchase a large
and varied supply of roses, violets and heliotrope,
which only dollars could buy from a
New York florist. No hot-houses are needed
here at any season, for in this climate flowers
bloom all the year round, and one crop succeeds
another in a never-ending succession. The
Mexican Indian is a lover of flowers. It is one
of the redeeming traits of his character. He
is not always particular as to his personal appearance;
he may be unkempt and untidy to
look upon; but he loves flowers, is prodigal in
his use of them and shows good taste in their
arrangement. This taste is innate, is no doubt
inherited from his Aztec ancestors, and has
survived the oppressions and exactions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
succeeding centuries. This love for flowers
finds expression even in his worship, and it is
no uncommon thing to find flowers before the
image of the Virgin, and such an offering is one
of the expressions of his good will. When we
consider that our forefathers were taught to
worship God with the first fruits of their husbandry,
it is not surprising that this primitive
and ignorant race should still find use in their
worship for these beautiful products of a prodigal
nature.</p>

<p>The gardens and parks of the City of Mexico
attain a luxuriant growth that cannot be
equalled in our northern cities. These breathing-places
where one can sit amid scenes of
tropical verdure, and admire the bright tints
of the flowers while shielded from the hot sun
by the broad-leafed foliage of the plants, are
truly delightful spots for an American to visit.
They contrast so strongly with the cheerless
appearance of the streets. In the centre of the
large Plaza Mayor lies the Zocalo, a little green
oasis in the great paved waste. It is in the
very heart of the city’s throbbing life, and
everything either has its beginning or ending
on this imposing square.</p>

<p>On one side of the Plaza lies the Palacio Nacional
which has stood there for more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
two centuries. It covers the site of the ancient
palace of Montezuma, and has an imposing
façade of nearly seven hundred feet. Over the
main entrance hangs the Liberty Bell of Mexico
which was rung by Hidalgo on the first call
to independence at Dolores, where it had so
often summoned the people to mass. The immense
windows which look out upon the Plaza
open into the various rooms where the official
business of the executive department of the
republic is transacted. Other parts of this
immense structure, for it is almost a square
building enclosing an open court, are occupied
by the legislative chambers and barrack rooms
for several regiments of soldiers.</p>

<p>A few blocks away from the Plaza lies the
Alameda, which is the park of the better
classes. Every city has an alameda, as the visitor
soon learns, but this is <i>the</i> alameda of
Mexico. It is a pretty place, and, with its beautiful
trees, flowers and fountains, forms a resort
for the fashionable people, who congregate
here on Sundays and feast days to listen to
the military bands. The visitor can almost lose
himself in this part, for the view is circumscribed
on every hand by the dense shrubbery.</p>

<p>It is on the subject of the Paseo de la Reforma
that the Mexican becomes enthusiastic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
This beautiful boulevard extends for a distance
of two miles from a place near the Alameda
to Chapultepec. It is a smooth thoroughfare
averaging five hundred feet in width, with
promenades on each side shaded by trees under
which are stone seats, and with paved driveways
in the centre. Here and there the Paseo
widens into circles, called <i>glorietas</i>, in the centre
of which are placed statues. Those already
erected include statues to Charles IV of Spain,
Columbus and Cuautemoc, the Aztec warrior
and emperor. To Maximilian is due the credit
for the Paseo, and a more beautiful boulevard
cannot be found in Europe or America.</p>

<p>I have purposely described the old features
of the city and the unique characteristics before
touching upon the more modern innovations.
The average visitor would follow that plan,
for he would be more interested in the unusual
than in that with which he is more or less
familiar. Like all capitals and large cities
affected by commercialism, the City of Mexico
is fast becoming cosmopolitan. The traveller
who visited it ten, or even five, years ago would
be astonished at the changes wrought by improvements.
The fine system of electric lights,
the excellent electric traction lines with modern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
cars, the asphalted streets
and the attractive new suburbs of an entirely
foreign architecture, link the old with the new,
the sixteenth with the twentieth century. A
city hindered by a racial conservatism, and
obstructed at every turn by tradition, does not
become entirely modern in a decade, but the
trend is there and its progress has been really
remarkable. It will never be a city of skyscrapers
for a hard stratum is not encountered
until a depth of a hundred and forty feet is
reached.</p>

<p>A new and modern hotel is more needed than
anything else. There are plenty of hotels of
the Mexican kind, where it is almost impossible
to find a room with an outside window. All
the rooms simply have an opening on the <i>patio</i>
which answers for both door and window. In
cool weather which is sometimes experienced
here, there is no means of heating these rooms
except by an open pan of coals, which is not
very satisfactory to one accustomed to modern
steam-heated hotels or a good stove.</p>

<p>The national government controls the federal
district within which is situated the City of
Mexico, much the same as the District of Columbia,
in our own land, and is assisted by a
city council. Plans have been drawn for fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
million dollars’ worth of public buildings, many
of which are already under way. The fine new
post-office which has been building for several
years is now occupied by that department. It
is a beautiful structure of the medieval Spanish
style, and is a striking departure from the
other public buildings. It is four stories high,
equipped with every convenience and is finished
within and without in elaborate style.</p>

<p>A new legislative palace is under construction,
which is the most pretentious building
yet planned. Its estimated cost is $20,000,000.
Opposite the post-office a national theatre is
being erected to cater to the amusement lovers,
which is designed to be the finest theatre in
the new world. An entire block is being razed
to make room for the Panteon Nacional—a
resting place for Mexico’s illustrious dead.
Within the marble walls of this unique memorial
will rest all that is mortal of her heroes.
An army and navy building, a museum of art
and a department of public works are among
the other improvements planned for the capital.
These buildings are being scattered over the
city instead of following the group plan as designed
at Washington. The reason for this has
been a desire to have every section of the city
benefited and beautified by these public structures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
The year 1910 marked the centennial of
Mexican independence. The month of September
was almost wholly given up to celebrations
of this event in the capital. A number of public
buildings were dedicated during the celebrations.
Among these were a new insane asylum
and several fine new public school buildings,
which greatly added to the educational facilities
of the city. A magnificent new monument
to independence, recently erected on the Paseo,
was dedicated with great ceremony. A number
of gifts were made by foreign colonies and
governments. Not the least of these was a
monument to Washington, which was presented
by the resident Americans. The ceremonies
and functions of the centennial celebration
were very elaborate, and the capital has been
beautified in many ways as a result.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE VALLEY OF ANAHUAC</span></h2>

<p>The dim traditionary history of Mexico
shows us shadowy tribes flitting across the
stage, each acting its part like the different
performers in a vaudeville show, and then making
way for other actors. The Valley of Mexico,
or Anahuac, meaning “near the water,”
seems to have been the centre of the civilization
of these early tribes. It is a beautiful
valley nearly sixty miles in length and thirty
in breadth, and is enclosed by a wall of mountains
which circumscribe the view in every
direction. Six shallow lakes lie in this hollow:
Texcoco, Xochimilco, San Cristobal, Xaltocan,
Zumpango and Chalco, of which the first named
is the nearest to the city and lies distant about
three miles. It is easy to believe that the
waters of these lakes at one time entirely surrounded
the ancient city of Tenochtitlan, for
within historic times their shores have greatly
receded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of these early races rests mostly
upon tradition; yet a diversity of architectural
ruins, and the few meagre records that remain,
present certain general facts. These positive
proofs leave no doubt that this valley was inhabited
from a very early period by tribes or
nations which made distinct advances in civilization.
These tribes had developed certain of
the useful arts and had evolved a social system
that exhibited some refinement. The first of
these races of whom we have reliable record
are the Toltecs, who appeared in the Valley
of Mexico in the seventh century at almost
the same time that Mohammed was spreading
his religion over Asia and Africa. Their
sway lasted about five centuries, when they
disappeared as silently and mysteriously as
they came.</p>

<p>These peaceful and agricultural people were
succeeded by the Chichimecs, a more barbarous
race, who came from the north. They in turn
were followed by the Nahuals. Lastly came the
Aztecs, who entered the valley about 1196, and
reached a higher state of civilization than any
of their predecessors. War was their choicest
profession, for they considered that warriors
slain in battle were immediately transported to
scenes of ineffable bliss. They offered human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sacrifices to their gods. Prescott tells us of
a procession of captives two miles long, and
numbering seventy thousand persons who were
sacrificed at one time. This is incredible, for
at that rate the population would soon have
been exhausted even in this prolific land. Furthermore
we know that the Aztecs were not
always successful in war, and may have furnished
victims from their own numbers, for
sacrifice to the gods of the other nations in the
same land.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus13">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="420" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CALENDAR STONE</p>
<img src="images/illus13-inscription.jpg" width="500" height="280" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Aztecs were clever workers in gold and
silver, and were acquainted with a number of
arts that are lost to-day. Their picture writings
bear witness to a clever fancy and fertile
invention of symbols. The numerous idols
show their skill in carving and a true artistic
instinct. Many antiquities have been exhumed
from the swampy soil on which the capital city
is built, in making excavations for improvements.
The National Museum is a treasure
house of these relics and it would take a volume
to describe them. The huge Sacrificial Stone,
which is generally supposed to have been placed
on the top of the great altar, is preserved there.
It also houses the horrible image of the god
Huitzilopochtli, and a varied assortment of inferior
gods, goddesses, and other objects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
worship. But the most celebrated antiquity—the
one showing the greatest advancement—is
the Calendar Stone. This stone was buried
for centuries, and when resurrected was placed
in the west tower of the cathedral. From this
place it was removed a few years ago and
placed in the museum. It is a mighty stone,
eleven feet and eight inches in diameter, and
weighs more than twenty tons. The Aztecs
divided the year into eighteen months of twenty
days each, and then arbitrarily added five days
to complete the year.</p>

<p>“Let us follow the cross, and if we have
faith we will conquer,” was the motto on the
banner of Cortez. It was with this spirit that
he led his little band over the mountains and
into the heart of the empire of Montezuma, late
in the fall of 1519. He was met by that sovereign,
tradition says, on the site of the present
Hospital of Jesus, with every manifestation
of friendliness. For several months they
were the honoured guests of the Aztec chief,
but at length the aggressions of the Spaniards
changed friendship to hate and the Aztecs, rising
in their wrath, chased the invaders from
the city. Driven before the infuriated natives
like sheep, they fled over the present road to
the suburban village of Tacuba, and many were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
those who fell. This rout of the Spaniards has
been painted with wonderful vividness by Gen.
Lew Wallace in “The Fair God.”</p>

<p>It was an awful night of despair, that first
day of July, 1520, and the Spaniards who escaped
named it La Noche Triste, “the sorrowful
night.” The pursuit stopped at the little
town of Popotla. In this village is a great
cypress tree whose branches are blasted by the
storms of centuries. For a moment the strong
will of Cortez gave way and he sat down upon
a stone under the spreading branches of this
tree and wept. Whether he wept most for his
fallen soldiers or disappointment over his ignominious
defeat, we are not told by the chroniclers.
This tree is now noted as <i>el arbol de la
noche triste</i>, or “the tree of the sorrowful
night.” A high iron fence protects the ancient
relic from the souvenir vandals.</p>

<p>The Spaniards retreated beyond the valley
to their allies, the Tlaxcalans, at Cholula. Reinforcements
and supplies arriving, they returned
a few months later and began the
memorable siege of Tenochtitlan, and made a
triumphal entry into that city on the 13th of
August, 1521. Then Guatemotzin, the last of
the Aztec emperors, wept in his turn, because
the sacred fires of the temple had for ever gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
out, and his people would henceforth be slaves.
“Take that dagger,” he said, “and free this
spirit.” But, no, torture must come before
death, for Cortez fain would learn where the
gold was hidden that had so suddenly disappeared.
To-day, in the City of Mexico, a statue
stands in one of the circles of the famous Paseo,
which commemorates this great warrior and
his torture by the Spanish chieftain. This
monument is greatly cherished by the Indians,
who hold annual festivals in his honour and
decorate it with a profusion of flowers and
wreaths.</p>

<p>The great Valley of Mexico is without a natural
outlet, and this fact has caused seven inundations
of the capital during exceptionally
rainy seasons. One of the lakes, Zumpango, is
twenty-five feet higher than the city and drains
into Texcoco, from which the waters spread
over the city. When the first serious inundations
came in 1553, 1580 and 1604, the project
of removing the city to a higher level was
strongly agitated. It was only the loss of millions
of dollars of property that prevented
this action. Then the idea of draining this
valley was definitely adopted and the work was
begun in 1607. A tunnel was decided upon
and fifteen thousand Indians were set at work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sinking shafts and driving the tunnel in both
directions. Within a year a tunnel four miles
long had been completed. This tunnel eventually
caved in, so that very little good was realized
from it and efforts were made to convert
it into an open cut. But this undertaking was
not finished until two centuries later. It is a
great trench, however, with an average depth
of from one hundred and fifty to two hundred
feet, and from three hundred to seven hundred
feet in width at the top. It is called the <i>Tajo
de Nochistongo</i>, or Nochistongo cut, and its
only use now is as an entrance for the Mexican
Central railway. Even this waterway did not
drain the valley, remarkable engineering feat
as it was, but a new canal was constructed by
American engineers a few years ago which successfully
accomplishes the work of draining
these shallow lakes and carrying off the sewerage
of the city.</p>

<p>The first Aztecs who settled in this valley
lived almost entirely in the marshes and lakes,
we are told, because of the hostility of their
fierce neighbours. They were thus obliged to
depend almost wholly upon the products of
these watered lands for their sustenance, and
they acquired some strange and—we would
say—depraved tastes. A reminder of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
days is seen in the cakes made of the eggs of
a curious marsh-fly, which are sold in the market
of the City of Mexico to-day. The flies themselves
are pounded into a paste and sold after
being boiled, but the eggs are preferred. The
Indians collect the eggs in a systematic manner.
Bundles of a certain kind of sedge are planted
in Lake Texcoco and the insects deposit their
eggs thereon in great quantities. These bundles
as soon as covered are shaken over pieces
of cloth and replaced for another supply. The
eggs thus collected are made into a paste and
form a favourite article of food, especially
during Lent.</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn what different races
regard as toothsome dainties. In Southern
Mexico I have seen bushels of common grasshoppers
sold in the markets as a delicacy, reminding
one of the locusts and wild honey used
as food in Biblical times. In other parts of
Mexico the honey-ant is greatly sought after
for food. The natives of Central America are
partial to the iguana, a large lizard sometimes
reaching a length of three or four feet, and prefer
it to beef. After all there is no accounting
for tastes. A man who eats snails might criticize
another who relishes oysters. And perhaps
the man who want his cheese “ripe”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
should not criticize the poor Indian who has
inherited a taste for the eggs of the fly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;" id="illus14">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" width="420" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SCENES ON THE VIGA CANAL</p>
</div>

<p>There are many places of interest round
about the City of Mexico which are easily
reached. One should not fail to visit the famous
<i>jardines flotandos</i> or “floating gardens”
where the beautiful flowers sold in the market
are grown. These gardens, called by the Aztecs
<i>chinampas</i>, are reached by the Viga Canal.
The inquirer is told to take a gondola and float
down to them. The name gondola excites pleasant
anticipations of a delightful trip. Entering
a mule-car at the Plaza Mayor the canal is
soon reached after traversing a number of narrow
streets which would not especially delight
the fastidious traveller. The gondoliers take
the stranger almost by force and urge him into
one of the flea-infested boats that abound at the
landing, and which more resemble a collection
of mud-scows than any other kind of floating
fleet. Instead of using oars these queer gondoliers
with the picture hats pole the boat
through the muddy waters of La Viga, stirring
up odours which cause the passenger to wish
that he was not gifted with the sense of smell,
or that he could temporarily dispense with
breathing. However, there is life in the stream
and on the banks that is typically Mexican, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
boats are constantly passing up and down. Occasionally
a load of Indians will float by playing
native airs on guitars and other string
instruments, with the light-heartedness and
gaiety peculiar to this race. On the bank are
scattered many native thatch huts around which
idle natives group. Along the road pass men
and women going to and from the city with
loads on their heads or on their backs. The
“floating gardens” are always just beyond.
They are first at Santa Anita but, when this
place is reached, they are at Mexicalcingo.
Arrived there the visitor is sent to Ixtacalco,
and then he is forwarded to Xochimilco, and
so the real floating gardens are never reached.
The fact is that they do not float and perhaps
never did. This characteristic only exists in
the imagination, for it sounds romantic to speak
of gardens that can be moved around and anchored
at will.</p>

<p>Disembarking at an unattractive mud and
thatch village bearing the charming name of
Santa Anita, self constituted guides are waiting
to conduct you to the object of your visit, something
which does not literally exist. Yet the
“floating gardens” are all about you at this
place. They are simply marsh lands with canals
leading in and out and crossways by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of which the gardener can reach all parts in
his boat. The earth may yield somewhat if you
step upon it, but they do not float. It is possible,
and historians so assert, that floating gardens
did exist in reality during the Aztec invasion.
These people were frequently driven to
dire extremities to secure food. They may have
adopted the plan of making floating gardens
which could be moved about as necessity compelled.
This was done by culling masses of
vegetation with its thick entwined stems and
pouring upon this mat the rich mud dredged
from the bottom of the lake. Then, as the
masses settled, more mud was put on until the
whole anchored upon the bottom of the lake
and became immovable. The gardens look
beautiful, covered as they are with the many-coloured
blossoms. By means of the canals the
roots are kept thoroughly moist at all times,
and the plants thrive luxuriantly.</p>

<p>This canal of La Viga was formerly a great
trade route, for a large part of the natives came
to the City of Mexico by this way. It leads
back into regions where dwell full blooded Aztecs
who speak a language that is said to be
almost the pure ancient tongue. These natives
can be distinguished from all others on the
street and in the market by their features and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
peculiar dress. They are clannish and keep by
themselves, except in the intercourse made
necessary by barter and trade. They are proud
of their lineage and rejoice in the fact that they
have not mingled with the other native races.</p>

<p>Tacuba, distant only a few miles, is an interesting
little village, and has many gardens and
a fine old church. It is a good place to study
the people and get snap-shots of quaint life.
Its principal distinction is that it was a proud
city when Tetlepanquetzaltzin was king once
upon a time. Texcoco at the time of the conquest
was the capital of the Tezcucans, who
were a race in alliance with the Aztecs, but it
is now principally in ruins, for its glory has
passed away. El Desierto was once the home
of the Carmelite monks and is frequently visited
now in its decay. Coyoacan was the first
capital of Mexico, for Cortez established the
seat of government there for a time while the
new city was being built.</p>

<p>Tacubaya is the home of the wealthy as well
as the sporting element. It has beautiful gardens
within the adobe walls surrounding the
homes of the opulent. It is on higher ground
and should have been the site of the capital city
itself. It is also called the Monte Carlo of
Mexico, for gamblers of all sorts and conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
congregate here in booths or under umbrellas,
and you can lose any sum at games of chance
as at that famous resort along the shores of the
blue Mediterranean. Games, music, dancing,
cock-fights, and bull-fights are a few of the attractions
to amuse and entertain the visitor,
and relieve him from the burden of carrying
around the weighty silver pesos.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus15">

<p class="caption">CASTLE OF CHAPULTEPEC</p>
</div>

<p>In all this beautiful and historic Valley of
Mexico there is no more beautiful spot, or none
around which so many memories cling, as Chapultepec,
the Hill of the Grasshoppers. Historic
and beautiful Chapultepec! A great grove
of noble cypresses draped with masses of Spanish
moss surrounds this rock, and between the
trees and along the shores of a pretty little lake
wind enchanting walks. One grand old cypress
called Montezuma’s tree rises to a height of
one hundred and seventy feet. It is a magnificent
breathing spot—with which no park that
I have ever seen in America compares. Legend
says that on the top of this rock was situated
the palace of Montezuma, and it is probably
only legend. No doubt that emperor often
rested himself under the friendly shade of the
great <i>ahuehuete</i>, and reflected on the glory of
his empire before the disturbing foreigners
came. The present Castle of Chapultepec dates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
from 1783 when it was begun by one of the
viceroys. Later viceroys, presidents and an
emperor added to the original building until
now it is a palace indeed but not a beautiful
structure. Ill-fated Maximilian made this his
home and added greatly to the beauty of the
grounds. It is now the White House of Mexico
although occupied only a part of the year by the
president.</p>

<p>Perhaps nowhere in the world does there
exist a more beautiful scene than that which
unfolds to the view from this rock. All around
is the great sweep of plain with its wealth of
cultivated fields; the distant mountain range
with its ever varying outline; the snow-capped
twin peaks, Popocatapetl (seventeen thousand,
seven hundred and eighty-two feet) and Ixtaccihuatl
(sixteen thousand and sixty feet), standing
like silent sentinels and dominating the
horizon; the silver line of the lakes; and beneath
us the fair City of Mexico, the ancient
Tenochtitlan. Legend says that Popocatepetl,
“the smoking mountain,” and Ixtaccihuatl,
“the woman in white,” were once living giants
but that having displeased the Almighty they
were changed to mountains. The woman died
and the contour of her body covered with snow
can be traced on the summit of the smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
peak. The man was doomed to live for ever
and gaze on the sleeping form of his beloved.
At times when his grief becomes uncontrollable
he shakes with his great sobs and pours
forth tears of fire.</p>

<p>As I stood on that historic rock I thought
of the New World Venice described by Prescott,
“with its shining cities and flowering
islets rocking, as it were, at anchor on the fair
bosom of the waters.” Rising above all was
the great sacrificial altar upon which the sacred
fires were ever kept burning. Beneath
this rock under the friendly branches of the
giant cypress Montezuma has no doubt sheltered
himself from the hot sun. Cortez here
rested himself after his severe marches.
French zouaves in their quaint uniforms have
bivouacked in the grove. American blue-coats
stacked their arms here after the victory
of Molino-del-Ray. And Mexicans now
take their siestas under the same friendly
shade while other races are robbing them of
their wealth.</p>

<p>Yes, historic scenes and tragedies have taken
place on this plain. Nations have come and
gone. Victors have themselves been led away
captives, and taskmasters have in turn become
slaves. How finite is man or his works in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
presence of this great panorama of nature!
Races have come and gone but the mountains
endure. Human tragedies have been enacted
here but the sky is just as blue and the sun just
as bright, as when Cortez looked with envious
eyes upon this beautiful valley. The mimic
play of men, and women and races upon this
amphitheatre has scarcely left its imprint.
The only occasions when the calm serenity of
nature has been disturbed were when the giant
Popocatapetl, overcome with grief at the loss
of his beloved, has shaken this whole valley
with his sobs and poured forth plenteous tears
of fire over its fair surface.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TROPICS</span></h2>

<p>In no country in the world is it possible to
move from one extreme of climate to the other
in so short a time as in Mexico. Within less
than twenty-four hours one can travel from
the sun-baked sands of the Gulf coast to the
snow-covered, conical peak of one of the great
extinct volcanoes, thus traversing every zone
of vegetable life from the dense tropical
growth of the former to the stunted pines of
the latter. By railway it is a journey of only
a few hours from the plateaus, at an altitude
of eight thousand feet, to the sea level, and a
most interesting ride it is. The Mexican Railway,
which is the oldest railway in the republic,
runs from the capital to Vera Cruz and is
the best route, for its wonderful engineering
feats and beautiful scenery have drawn tourists
from all parts of the world. Leaving the
capital, the road skirts the bank of Lake Texcoco,
through a pass in the mountains surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the Valley of Mexico, and across the
Plains of Apam, the home of the maguey, for
a hundred and fifty miles before the exciting
part of the trip is reached.</p>

<p>The descent begins at Esperanza, which lies
at the very foot of Mt. Orizaba. Esperanza
means “hope” and it is well named for the
traveller can “hope” for better things as the
train approaches the coast. Noah’s Ark rests
near here, for I saw it with my own eyes labelled
in plain letters, <i>Arc de Noe</i>, but it is
now—sad to tell—devoted to the sale of
pulque. Esperanza is eight thousand and
forty-four feet above the sea and one hundred
and twelve miles from Vera Cruz as the track
runs, but much nearer as the crow would fly.
There is a drop of four thousand, one hundred
feet in the next twenty-nine miles and it is
one of the grandest rides in the world. In
places the road seems like a little shelf on the
side of a towering mountain while a yawning
chasm awaits the coach below. As soon as
Boca del Monte (Mouth of the Mountain) is
reached, only a few miles from Esperanza, the
downward impetus is felt and all the energy
of the curious double-ended English engines is
devoted to holding back the heavy train with
its human cargo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing through a tunnel here, the scene
bursts upon the traveller without any warning
or prelude, in all its grandeur and magnificence.
The engine accommodatingly stops for
water so that the passengers have an opportunity
to view this wonderful panorama. Maltrata
nestles in the hollow, a dozen miles away
by rail, yet the red tiles of the roofs, a red-domed
church and the ever-present plaza gleam
in the sunshine two thousand feet directly
underneath. The valley is almost flat and is
divided into squares by hedges and walls and,
reflecting every shade of green, looks like a
checker-board arrangement of nature. Beyond
the valley, hill succeeds hill until they are
lost in the purple haze of the horizon, or are
overtopped by snow-capped Orizaba. Indians
appear here with beautiful bouquets of roses,
tulips and orchids, with their yellow, pink and
red centres, for sale. The train passes on over
a narrow bridge spanning a deep chasm and
down the mountain until Maltrata is reached,
where the same Indians will greet you with
the same bouquets, for they have climbed down
the two thousand feet in less time than it took
the train to reach the same level.</p>

<p>Leaving Maltrata the road enters a cañon
called <i>El Infernillo</i>, the Little Hell, goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
through a tunnel and another beautiful valley,
running through fertile fields and by wooded
hills, until Orizaba, the border-land of the
tropics, is reached.</p>

<p>This city at an altitude of four thousand feet
is in the <i>tierra templada</i>, the temperate region.
This zone is as near paradise in the matter of
climate as any location on earth could well be.
It retains most of the beauties and few of the
annoying insects and tropical fevers of the hot
zone. It has the moisture of the lowlands with
the cool breezes of the uplands and is well
named “temperate zone” because of its fine
climate and equable temperature.</p>

<p>Orizaba is a town of thirty-five thousand
people and a very beautiful and interesting
place with its palm-shaded streets and low
Moorish buildings. Its Alameda is a quaint,
shady park with an abundance of flowers and
blooming trees. Along the street the orange
trees thrust their laden branches out into the
highway over the low adobe walls. On the
banks of the stream the washerwomen beat
their clothes to a snowy white upon the smooth
round stones. Life moves along in smooth,
easy channels with these people. And it is
not to be wondered at, for there is</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A sense of rest</div>
<div class="verse">To the tired breast</div>
<div class="verse">In this beauteous Aztec town.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Between Orizaba and Cordoba, a distance of
sixteen miles, is perhaps the best cultivated
section in Mexico. The products of all the
zones are mingled and corn and coffee grow
side by side as well as peach trees and the
banana. Cordoba is just on the border of the
<i>tierra caliente</i>, or hot country proper, and is
a much smaller city than Orizaba. It is a very
old town and was founded as a place of refuge
from the malarial fevers of the coast lands.
This region is noted for its fine coffee, and
there are numberless coffee plantations as well
as many sugar <i>haciendas</i>. The Mexican of the
tropics can be seen here dressed in immaculate
white. Leaving Cordoba dense tropical forests
of palm and palmetto begin to appear.
These alternate with groves of coffee and bananas,
gardens of mangoes, fields of pineapples
and other tropical fruits. Nature begins
to manifest herself in her grandest productions.
Birds of brilliant plumage are seen.
The towering trees, rocks and entire surface
of the soil are covered with bright flowers such
as orchids, oleanders and honeysuckles and
luxuriant vines. These and the dense jungles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
are all reminders that the tropics have been
reached at last. Soon the train enters Vera
Cruz, the city without cabs, the landing-place
of the great conquistador and his cohorts.</p>

<p>The principal port now, as it has always been
since the landing of Cortez on the twenty-first
day of April, 1519, is Vera Cruz, or, as he
named it, <i>La Villa Rica de Vera Cruz</i>—the
Rich City of the True Cross. Most Americans
who pass through here leave by the very first
train or boat for fear of pestilence. I met one
fellow-countryman there who was almost beside
himself because the boat he had expected
to take was delayed a couple of days. This
city is reputed to be the favourite loafing-place
of the <i>stegomyia fasciata</i> whose bite results in
the <i>vomito</i>, or yellow fever. If all the sensational
reports sent out concerning this city
were true then “Pandora’s box was not a
circumstance to the evils which Vera Cruz contains.”
I had read in Mr. Ober’s excellent
work on Mexico of an American consul who
died here just thirteen days after reaching the
port that his ambition had led him to; and of
the terrible ravages of the scourge when deaths
were averaging forty per day. I arrived there
after night had set in. Eating a light supper
and seeing that my name was duly posted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the big blackboard bulletin according to the
custom prevailing there, I retired to my room,
and only breathed freely after securely drawing
the mosquito netting around my bed so that
it would be impossible for a <i>stegomyia</i> to get
through.</p>

<p>It was almost a surprise on the following
morning to find able-bodied Americans and
husky Englishmen pursuing their avocations
in an unconcerned way as though such things
as yellow fever or smallpox were not to be
thought of. Then, again, I was alarmed at the
numerous red flags hanging out, which I took
to be quarantine flags, for everything is different
here. Upon investigation this alarm
was dispelled, for those places proved to be
pulque-shops and the flag meant that a fresh
supply of the “liquor divine” had just been
received. It is probably true that Vera Cruz
was a hot-bed for the <i>vomito</i> a few years ago,
but Mexican statistics report only twelve deaths
in 1904 and one hundred and twenty-two in
1905 from this disease, which is not bad for
a city of thirty thousand people, where a large
proportion of the population cannot be made
to obey the ordinary laws of sanitation. I
doubt whether the death rate is much greater
than in our own cities on the Gulf coast. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
change is due to the better situation that has
been brought about by the authorities.</p>

<p>An adequate supply of pure water was the
first important step in this move for improved
conditions. This was secured by utilizing the
water of the Jamapa River at a point about
twelve miles distant and passing this water
through several filtering beds before turning it
into the mains which supply the city. A sewerage
system has been constructed, by means
of which the sewerage is carried out and discharged
into deep water so that the harbour
will not be contaminated. Disinfecting stations
have been established and a plant for the
disposition of garbage. Then in addition to
the regular force of health officers, there is a
large volunteer street cleaning brigade. These
volunteer forces are not on the pay-roll and
yet they do their work in a thorough manner
even if their methods cannot be approved.
Their only reward is the enforcement of a fine
of five dollars for the protection of their lives.
By the natives these street cleaners are called
<i>zopilotes</i> but to an American they are plain,
every-day buzzards. Hundreds of these birds
can be seen perched on the roof-tops or waddling
through the streets.</p>

<p>For centuries the port of Vera Cruz was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
bane of vessel owners for there was no protection
from the severe “Northers” so prevalent
on the Gulf and it was one of the most inconvenient
and dangerous harbours on that coast.
It was for this reason that Cortez destroyed
the vessels which had brought his forces over
from Cuba. An excellent harbour has been
constructed at great cost and ocean-going vessels
can now anchor alongside of the main pier
and unload. A large new union station will at
once be erected by the four railways entering
this city on a site adjoining the pier, which will
further increase the facilities of this port.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BUZZARDS OF VERA CRUZ</p>
<p class="caption">AVENUE OF PALMS, VERA CRUZ</p>
</div>

<p>The fortress of San Juan de Ulua, now a
prison, and which is reached by a short sail
through the shark-infested harbour, is an interesting
structure and has seen many vicissitudes.
Used as a fort for several centuries by
the Spaniards, it has successively been occupied
by the French, Americans, and again by
the French and their allies in the war of the
intervention. The buildings in Vera Cruz are
nearly all low, one-storied structures of adobe,
and the walls are tinted in red, yellow, blue
and green, thus furnishing to the eye a pleasing
variety and, with the bay, reminding one
of Cadiz in old Spain. There is an attractive
plaza and an imposing avenue of the cocoanut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
palm. Vera Cruz is the gateway to the capital
and many millions of imports and exports pass
through here each year, as much as at all the
other ports of Mexico combined, leaving out
Progresso, on the Yucatan coast, through
which the henequen traffic is carried.</p>

<p>Tampico is the second Gulf port in importance
and on the completion of a direct route
to the capital will be a close rival to Vera Cruz.
Coatzacoalcos is the Gulf port of the Tehuantepec
railway and will become an important
port. The Pacific coast affords better natural
harbours. Acapulco is one of the finest natural
land-locked harbours in the world. Though
now of secondary importance because of the
absence of railroad connections, at one time
this picturesque harbour sheltered the old
Spanish galleons engaged in the East India
trade. Their freight was unloaded there and
transported overland on the backs of burros
and mules to Vera Cruz and re-shipped to
Spain. Manzanillo is an important seaport on
that coast and will soon be connected by rail
with the capital, when its importance will be
greatly increased. Other important ports on
that coast are Mazatlan, Guayamas, San Blas
and Salina Cruz, the Pacific port of the Tehuantepec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
route, where the great harbour is
nearly completed.</p>

<p>The <i>tierra caliente</i> comprises a fringe of low
plains which extend inland from the coast a
distance varying from a few miles in width to
a hundred or more. From thence it rises by
a succession of terraces until the great inland
plateaus are reached. The higher the altitude
the lower the temperature, and it is estimated
that there is a change of 1.8 degree Fahrenheit
for each sixty feet of elevation in this region.
This zone is characterized by the grandeur and
variety of vegetable life, and it is an almost
uninterrupted forest except where it has been
cleared. A ride through the tropics is a revelation
of what nature can do when aided by
a never-ending succession of warm sunshine
and abundant rain upon rich soil. Trees of
great height and size are interspersed among
plants which are generally of a tree-like nature,
and are conspicuous for the development
of their trunks and ramifications. The innumerable
species of reeds and creeping plants
that entwine themselves in a thousand different
ways among the trees and plants make a
passage almost impossible. It is for this reason
that the natives always go around armed
with the <i>machete</i>, a long blade very much like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a corn-cutter, for it enables them to cut their
way through the dense undergrowth, and is a
protection, should any danger be encountered.
The palms which are ever associated with the
tropics are seen in great profusion and in
countless varieties. Millions of ferns and
broad-leaved plants which would be welcomed
in the gardens and groves of northern homes
are wasting their graceful beauty in these
jungles and wildernesses. Trees are covered
with beautiful orchids and vines coil about the
trunks and limbs like great snakes, and then
drop down to the earth and take root again in
the damp soil.</p>

<p>To those who know them the tropics are not
so terrible, treacherous though they may seem.
Some enter this zone with a feeling of creepiness
as though they were entering a darkened
sick-room sheltering some malignant disease.
They hesitate to breathe for fear that the very
air is poisonous and they may take in the
germs of some malady with an unpronounceable
name. They shrink from nature as
though she had ceased to be the kind mother
to which they were accustomed in the colder
climates. It is true that there is something
horribly creepy and uncanny about this inevitable
tropical growth, which is so frail and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
fragile outwardly but seems possessed of an
unconquerable vitality. And yet in many of
the so-called unhealthy places, there is scarcely
more danger to health than elsewhere, if one
but observes the same rules of right living.
Continuous hard labour, such as the northern
farmer is accustomed to devote to his little
farm, is not possible. Exposure to the intense
heat of the sun at midday and the heavy rains
will bring on fevers and malaria just as surely
as it produces the luxuriant vegetation. For
this reason the tropics will probably never be
suited for colonization by the small farmer
who is fascinated with the possibilities offered
by land capable of producing two or three
crops in a single year.</p>

<p>In general, Mexico is poorly supplied with
rivers. However, along the Atlantic coast they
are very numerous and large, although not
navigable for any great distance, or for vessels
large enough to be of much aid to commerce.
The size of the rivers is due to the great
amount of rainfall, which varies from seventy
to one hundred and eighty inches annually.
When this is compared to an annual rainfall
of twenty to forty inches in the northern states
of the United States, the conditions in the tropics
are better understood. This excessive rainfall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
washes down earth from the higher ground
and this, together with the layers of vegetable
mold, have formed soil from eight to fourteen
feet in depth thus making it practically inexhaustible.
The temperature varies from 70°
to 100° Fahrenheit. The Pacific coast has a
higher temperature and less rainfall than the
Gulf coast. However, there is a stretch of land
extending north of Acapulco along the coast
and from eight to thirty miles wide that is
unrivalled for tropical beauty and productiveness.
There are many rivers and streams that
traverse this land on the way from the great
mountains to the Pacific.</p>

<p>There is a charm about the life in the hotlands
that is missing in other parts of Mexico.
Of all the inhabitants of that country, the life
of the people in the hot country is the most
interesting. This is probably due to the fact
that these people have always had more freedom
than the Indians on the plateaus who were
practically slaves for a couple of centuries.
The great estates there required sure help and
the natives were reduced to serfs. In the mines
they were worked with soldiers set over them
as guards. In the hotlands it was easier to
make a living, for a bountiful nature supplied
nearly all their wants. And yet many employers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of labour say that the peon from the hot
country makes the most satisfactory workman.
These Indians seem like a superior race. For
one thing they are scrupulously clean which,
in itself, is a pleasing contrast to the daily
sights in Northern Mexico. Water is abundant
everywhere; the extreme heat renders bathing
a great comfort and their clothes are kept immaculate.
They are fond of social life and
almost every night groups can be seen gathered
together in some kind of entertainment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus17">
<img src="images/illus17.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN INDIAN HOME IN THE HOT COUNTRY</p>
</div>

<p>Their homes are different from those in the
colder lands. The houses of the middle and
lower classes are built of bamboo or other light
material found in the tropical jungles, and
thatched with palm leaves. The upright bamboo
poles are often set an inch or more apart
thus giving a free circulation of air. An Indian
village generally consists of one long,
winding, irregular street lined on each side by
these picturesque huts, and bearing a strong
resemblance to a village in the interior of
Africa. Down these streets swarm in equal
profusion half-naked babies and children long
past the childhood stage dressed in the same
simple way, and hungry looking dogs. The
hot country is sparsely populated in comparison
with the plateaus and there are no large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cities, although archeologists tell us that the
earliest civilization seems to have been located
there. It could support a population many,
many times larger with ease.</p>

<p>The most productive parts of the world are
found in the <i>tierra caliente</i> which instead of
being given up to impenetrable jungles, the
homes of reptiles and breeding place of poisonous
insects, should be made to produce
those luxuries and necessaries which contribute
to make civilized life tolerable. All over
the world the fruits and other articles of the
tropics are coming into greater demand each
year. In the year 1906 the United States imported
fruits and other food products of tropical
countries, not including coffee, to the value
of more than $150,000,000, or nearly two dollars
for each man, woman and child in the
country. Of the purely tropical products,
sugar was by far the largest item on the list.
Bananas to the amount of $11,500,000 were
brought in, and were second on the list with
cacao a close rival for this place.</p>

<p>As yet Mexico supplies but a small portion
of these articles to the United States. Yet the
possibilities of agriculture here are equal to
those of any similar lands, and this, together
with superior transportation facilities and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
stable government, ought to greatly increase
the trade. In addition to the above items, this
soil is well adapted to the following fruits and
useful products, all of which are native to the
soil: oranges, lemons, limes, pineapples, grapefruit,
vanilla bean, indigo, rubber, coffee, tobacco
and many drug-producing plants. It is
difficult for the small farmer to succeed, as he
cannot do all his own labour in that climate
and cannot get satisfactory help just when it
is needed. He could not afford to hire a force
of labourers by the year. Successful farming
in the tropics can only be done on a large scale
with a regular force of labourers maintained
on the plantation. The title to the soil can be
purchased cheaply but the first cost of the land
is probably not more than one-third of the ultimate
cost by the time it is cleared, planted, and
the necessary improvements made. Furthermore
many tropical plants such as coffee, rubber
and cacao require several years of care
before there is a profitable yield.</p>

<p>Coffee and banana culture go hand in hand,
for the broad leaves of the banana provide the
shade so necessary to the young coffee trees.
The banana also furnishes a little revenue during
the four or five years before the coffee
trees have fully matured. The coffee region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is very extensive, for it will grow at a height
of from one to five thousand feet, and flourishes
best at an altitude of two to three thousand
feet. It requires plenty of warmth and
moisture. The coffee, which is a tree and not
a bush, is set out in rows several feet apart,
and will grow twenty feet tall if permitted, but
is not allowed to grow half that height. The
tree is flowering and developing fruit all the
time but the principal harvest is in the late
fall. It is not allowed to ripen on the tree, for
when the green berries have turned a bright
red, they are gathered, dried in the sun, hulled
and then marketed. The states of Vera Cruz
and Chiapas produce the choicest coffee, but
it is cultivated all over the republic where it is
possible. Coffee was introduced into this country
from Arabia by Spanish priests and was
found to be adapted to the soil. The best
grades are sent to Europe, for it is a common
saying throughout Mexico and Central America
that only the poor grades of coffee are sent
to the United States. This is rather a slur on
the tastes of the American people, but such is
our reputation down there.</p>

<p>“Looking at it from my point of view—the
lazy man’s outlook—I can see nothing so
inviting as coffee culture, unless it be a fat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
‘living’ in an English country church,” says
a writer. For myself, the one thing that appealed
to me above all others was the cultivation
of the banana. The returns are quick,
the income regular and the profits large. I
travelled through the banana region of Honduras,
where for thirty miles the railroad
passed by one plantation after another of the
broad-leaved banana plants growing as high
as fifteen feet. Great fortunes have been made
by the banana-growers of that country and
Costa Rica. This fruit flourishes best in the
lowlands. The preparation of the ground is
very simple, for the young banana plants are
set out among the piles of underbrush left after
clearing and which soon decay in that climate.
After nine months or a year the plants begin
to bear, and each stalk will produce one bunch
of bananas. The stalk is then cut down and
a new one, or several, will spring up from the
roots and will bear in the same length of time.
Thus a banana plantation that is carefully
looked after will produce a marketable crop
each week in the year, so that there is a constant
revenue coming in to the owner. The
cultivation of this delicious fruit, for which
there is an ever-increasing market, brings the
quickest return of any tropical product.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus18">
<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RICE CULTURE</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Sugar cane can be raised profitably as the
stalks grow high with many joints and have
a greater percentage of saccharine than in
most countries where it is cultivated. Furthermore
it does not require replanting so frequently.
Cacao is another truly tropical product.
It is from the cacao bean that chocolate is
made. The trees are usually transplanted and
bear in about four years and the beans are
gathered three or four times a year. They
are then removed from the pods and dried in
the sun. The trees will bear for many years.
Orange culture along modern scientific lines,
such as are used in California and Florida,
would be profitable, for the crop matures earlier
and could be marketed long before the
fruit has ripened in those states. The Mexicans
are great rice eaters and there is a good
field for its culture. The cocoanut palm offers
good returns as there is a good market for its
fruit. Rubber grows wild and many plantations
have been set out in rubber trees. In the
past year Mexico has shipped more than two
million pounds of crude rubber, and the production
is increasing. Vast tracts of mahogany
are found down toward Guatemala in the
states of Campeche and Tabasco. These great
trees are cut down, hewn square and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
hauled by mules to a waterway where they are
formed into rafts and floated down to the
ports. There is much waste in the present
crude way of cutting and marketing this valuable
wood. Logwood and other dyewoods are
found in the same forests. The world’s supply
of chicle also comes from the same source.</p>

<p>What the Mexican tropics need is men of
energy backed by capital sufficient to utilize
large tracts of this rich soil. It is true that
many plantations are now being cultivated and
it is equally true that many have been abandoned
as failures after unsuccessful attempts
at cultivation. The fault has not been poor
soil but poor management. Promotion and
success are not synonymous terms, and much
of the promotion has been done by unscrupulous
persons whose only purpose was to dispose
of stock to the gullible. Richer soil cannot
be found anywhere, but it must be cultivated
with intelligence and good judgment the
same as in any other part of the world, or failure
will result.</p>

<span class="smaller">A GLIMPSE OF THE ORIENTAL IN THE OCCIDENT</span></h2>

<p>Some two hundred miles south of the City
of Mexico lies Oaxaca (pronounced Wa-hâ-ka).
The Valley of Oaxaca was looked
upon by the Spanish conquerors as El Dorado,
the traditional land of gold. The Aztecs told
them that the gold of Montezuma came from
the sands of the rivers in this and the connecting
valleys, and that immeasurable treasure
was to be found there. Believing these tales,
Cortez secured large grants of land from the
crown, and, with the consent and approval of
his sovereign, assumed to himself the title of
Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca.</p>

<p>The cupidity of the Spaniards led them to
employ every subterfuge to induce the natives
to reveal the source of their plentiful supply
of gold. The Indians, after considerable urging,—so
we are told,—offered to conduct one
man to this place, if he would submit to be
blindfolded for the trip. This was agreed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and the party set out on their journey. Thinking
that he would mark the way, the Spaniard
dropped a grain of corn every few steps.
After they had travelled a long distance, the
Spaniard had the bandage removed from his
eyes and he was allowed to look around, when
he beheld such wealth as mortal vision never
before had seen. His eyes glittered with the
greed of his covetous nature, but his countenance
soon changed when a dusky warrior
stepped up and handed him a vessel which
contained every grain of corn that he had
dropped by the way. For this reason he was
never able to retrace his steps to this wonderful
region, and the wily Spaniards were again
outwitted by the simple natives.</p>

<p>Oaxaca is reached by the Southern Railway
which starts at Puebla. This road penetrates
one of the richest sections of the republic,
with abundance of timber and minerals, and
unlimited beds of onyx and marble. Little of
this wealth is seen from the railroad, as this
line follows the narrow valleys, through one
cañon into another, furnishing scenery as
grandly picturesque as the great passes of
Colorado. The mountains in places are lifted
up thousands of feet with crags and peaks
which the storms have cut into fantastic shapes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and whose walls drop almost perpendicularly
to the water’s edge. Then again the cañon
widens, and the panorama extends across the
valley where gigantic rocks, stained in all colours
by the oozings of the metals of the earth,
form far-away pictures not unlike the battlements
of an ancient fortress. The sun tinges
each a different hue, with deeper tones in the
near ones which fade as they approach the
horizon, until all seem to blend into the intense
blue of the sky.</p>

<p>As the train leaves the City of the Angels,
just at daybreak, a wonderful panorama is
opened up to view. Look in any direction, and
the tiled domes of the churches rise above the
plain, for each village and <i>hacienda</i> has its
own. The forts erected on the surrounding
hills which are emblematic of the force that
subjugated this valley, are seen, and near them
the pyramid of Cholula erected by those who
were overcome. Over all tower those mighty
monuments of nature, the white-capped peaks
of Popocatapetl, Ixtaccihuatl, Orizaba and old
Malintzi, with the morning sun reflected on
their snowy heads. The road ascends and descends,
and then ascends again before it takes
a dip down into the <i>tierra caliente</i>. A number
of native villages are passed but only one town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of any size, Tehuacan, noted for its mineral
springs. It is a pretty little city, and in the
centre of a rich agricultural district. The road
finally enters a wide, open country with rich
valleys which extend to the hills beyond. At
last, after a twelve hours’ journey, our train
rolls into this occidental Eden.</p>

<p>More than three centuries ago a Spanish
writer described Oaxaca as “not very big, yet
a fair and beautiful city to behold, which standeth
three-score leagues from Mexico in a pleasant
valley.” It is located at the junction of
three valleys and on the bank of a broad river,
which meanders through a billowy sea of cornfields
toward the Pacific. Whichever way the
eye may turn the view is bounded by hills covered
with forests. Viewed from one of these
hills the city looks like a broad, flat-covered
plain of stone buildings above which are seen
many domes, and the whole scene has a truly
oriental touch.</p>

<p>The people that the Spanish found in possession
of these valleys were an industrious race.
They had tilled the soil centuries before the
Spaniards, in their lust for gold, despoiled
these beautiful valleys. There is not a hollow,
or knoll, where it is possible to scrape a little
soil with a hoe, that has not at some time been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
cultivated. These early races had even constructed
irrigation works which kept green
their fields during the dry season. The rich
basins filled with alluvium are now owned by
the rich <i>hacendados</i>, or landowners, whose
white buildings dot the landscape here and
there and, with their trees, orchards and cultivated
fields, lend life and colour to an otherwise
dull prospect. The poor Indians are
forced to work for these landlords who claim
title to the land formerly owned by their ancestors,
or retire to the hills where, well up
toward the crests, they cultivate their little
fields of corn and beans. There is one tribe
of Indians that dwell in the mountains of
Oaxaca who have never acknowledged either
Spanish or Mexican sovereignty, and maintain
their own tribal form of government. They
can be seen at Oaxaca on market days.</p>

<p>We find Oaxaca to be a city of about thirty-three
thousand people of whom three-fourths
or more are Indians. It is laid out with narrow
streets, down the centre of which runs a
stream of water, from which rise at times
odours not the most agreeable. The houses
are low and one-storied, with grated windows
after the style of architecture introduced by
the Spaniards, and by them adopted from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Moors, who copied it from the Persians. The
water supply is abundant, being brought in
from the hills by an aqueduct. Fountains are
located at numerous places, and a constant succession
of Rebeccas with heads enveloped in
their shawls, and carrying great earthen water-jars
pass to and fro from them.</p>

<p>Oaxaca contains many fine churches of which
one, Santo Domingo, has been both monastery
and fortress, and has just been restored at a
cost of $13,000,000 (silver) so it is claimed,
making it the most costly church in Mexico,
if not in North America. The gold on the
walls was so heavy in former times, that the
soldiers quartered here during revolutionary
uprisings employed themselves in removing it.
This city has been the scene of troublous times,
and has been captured and re-captured by the
combating forces. It has given to the country
two great presidents, Juarez and Diaz, of
whom it may well be proud. Of these two
men, great in the annals of Mexico, the former
was a full-blooded Indian, and the latter has
a fair percentage of the same blood in his
veins. A monument to Juarez has been erected,
and some day—may it be far distant—when
nature has claimed her own, this city will raise
a memorial to her still greater son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Oaxaca has a pleasant plaza, called the Plaza
de Armas, adorned with various semi-tropical
trees and shrubs, in the centre of which is the
ever-present band-stand. The Cathedral and
municipal palace face this square. My visit
here was during a <i>fiesta</i> and this plaza was the
favourite resort of the Indians as well as myself.
The Indians living in the hills took undisturbed
possession at night, and groups of tired
<i>Indios</i> wrapped themselves in their <i>sarapes</i>,
or shawls, and stretched their tired limbs out
on the cold stones; or propped themselves
against the walls of a building to rest. A number
of catch-penny devices were running during
the evening and the favourite seemed to be
the phonograph. The Indian would pay his
<i>centavo</i>, put the transmitter in his ears and
listen without a sign of expression on his stolid
face. Nevertheless, he enjoyed it, because he
would repeat the operation until his stock of
coppers was considerably diminished.</p>

<p>Saturday is market day in this city, and a
visit to this popular place is worth a trip to
Mexico. The atmosphere of the market is
truly oriental, for these people have a genius
for trading as the innumerable little stands
where crude pottery, rough-made baskets,
home-made <i>dulces</i>, etc., are sold, fully proves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
The entrance takes one past the dealers in
fried meats, where bits of pork and shreds of
beef are dished out sizzling hot to the peons
under the big <i>sombreros</i> by women cooks who
crouch over earthenware dishes placed on
small braziers containing a charcoal fire, and
a three course meal can be obtained for a few
cents. There is always a crowd around this
department, for these people are ever ready
to eat, and their capacity is only limited by
their purse.</p>

<p class="caption">THE MARKET-WOMEN OF OAXACA</p>
<p class="caption">THE POTTERY-MARKET, OAXACA</p>
</div>

<p>Next is encountered the fruit and vegetable
stands. The finest fruits and vegetables, and
especially the latter, that I saw in Mexico, were
right here in this market and this was in the
month of December. Generally the vegetables
in Mexico are not large, but here were fine
potatoes, great red tomatoes, gigantic radishes
and elephantine cabbages. Oranges, bananas,
limes, plantains and pineapples were plentiful,
as well as the less-known fruits such as <i>zapotes</i>
(a kind of melon), <i>aguacates</i> (a pale green
fruit and vegetable combined), granaditas,
mangoes, granadas and pomegranates. The
cocoanut of the hotlands is mingled with the
<i>dunas</i>, the fruit of the prickly pear, of the
higher lands. With these a great many drinks
called <i>frescas</i>, or sherbets, are flavoured, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
merits of which are announced by the dark-eyed,
be-shawled vendors. The women merchants,
many of them smoking cigarettes, sit
around on the floor so thick in places that it
is almost impossible to work your way through
the mixed assortment of peppers and babies;
corn, lean babies and peas; charcoal, beans
and fat babies; naked babies, knives and
murderous-looking <i>machetes</i>; hats, laughing
babies, shawls and other useful articles; turkeys,
crying babies, chickens, dirty babies,
ducks, squawking parrots in cages, pigs and
other live stock, including babies of all kinds
and descriptions.</p>

<p>The pottery market presided over by the
solemn-faced, oriental merchants is a never-ending
place of interest, and these artistic
vessels are carried over the mountains on the
backs of the Indians. Crude baskets and mats
made of the palm fibre are found in abundance
as well as brooms which bear no union label.</p>

<p>No one could afford to miss the flower department
where flowers are so cheap that it
seems almost a sin not to buy them. Here are
velvety sweet peas, purple pansies, tangled
heaps of crimson and white roses, azure forget-me-nots,
pyramids of heliotrope and scarlet
geraniums. For a few cents one can buy almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a bushel of these, or, if preferred, can
substitute marguerites, carnations, poppies, or
violets. An American will probably have to
pay twice as much as a native, even after the
shrewdest bargaining.</p>

<p>Outside the market enclosure caravans of
over-loaded donkeys jostle each other as a
great solid-wheeled cart yoked to a couple of
meek-eyed oxen creaks by, or a tram car drawn
by galloping mules thunders noisily along to an
accompaniment of loud cracks of the whip,
and a constant repetition of “<i>mulas</i>” and
“<i>arres</i>” the “rrs” being brought out with
a long trill.</p>

<p class="caption">CROSSING THE RIVER ON MARKET-DAY</p>
</div>

<p>The Indian will travel for days on his way
to market at Oaxaca. On the day before
market I drove out the south road for a number
of miles, and the entire distance was literally
black,—or perhaps it would be better
to say brown,—with the natives coming to
town bearing the “brown man’s burden,” and
travelling along in the middle of the road at
a rapid pace. These Indians were coming
from the “hot country” farther south and
were bringing oranges, bananas, cocoanuts and
other kinds of tropical fruits, besides chickens,
eggs and other poultry. Most of them were
on foot, though the more fortunate had donkeys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to carry the load; but they themselves
walked and drove the animal. The women bore
large baskets on their heads, which they balanced
gracefully, although sometimes the loads
are exceedingly heavy. They will carry one
hundred pounds or more in this manner. Frequently
a baby is swung across the back as an
additional burden. The little mites are good
natured in this uncomfortable position, and do
not make half as much trouble as American
babies in their rubber-tired, easy-springed perambulators.</p>

<p>A small pot, a basket of tortillas, a few fagots
and plenty of coffee complete the outfit of
the man. Perhaps the value of his load is not
over a dollar or two in gold, but his entertainment
along the way costs little, for he sleeps
out of doors, carries his food, makes his own
coffee and needs to buy nothing except perhaps
a little fruit and <i>aguardiente</i> (brandy). The
entire family sometimes accompany him, for
the wife is afraid to have her man go away
alone for fear he may desert her.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the city from the
road just described is another main highway.
I stood here for several hours by the river
bank on the afternoon of a market-day, when
the people were leaving for home. The sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
never grew tiresome or monotonous, as there
was a constant succession of pictures, which a
moving-picture machine alone could adequately
portray. Although there is a bridge across the
stream, no one used it, for by making a short
cut across the river bed a hundred yards or
more was saved. The pedestrian would remove
his sandals to wade through the shallow
water, and then replace them on reaching the
opposite bank. The Indians going this way
had more burros, and, as their load was disposed
of, the family rode. Frequently a poor,
diminutive burro carried as many persons as
could sit on his back, in addition to the large
baskets. Many of the great carts drawn by
one or two yoke of oxen passed this way. The
cattle are all yoked by the horns, which seems
a cruel way, for their heads are brought down
almost to the ground, and it looks as though
every jar must cause them suffering.</p>

<p>So this unique panorama continued all the
afternoon. I could not think of anything but
Palestine, as I gazed at this unceasing procession
of donkeys, Egyptian carts, women with
their shawls folded and worn on their heads in
Eastern fashion; and in the background the
white walls, red tiled roofs and domes of the
churches of Oaxaca. For a moment I wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
if I were not mistaken, and had suddenly
strayed into some corner of the Orient, and
found myself involuntarily looking for the
mosque, and listening for the cry of the muezzin
calling the faithful to prayer.</p>

<p>A trip around about the valley near Oaxaca
only served to strengthen the oriental cast of
the picture. The types of buildings, and the
signs of water and fertility in the midst of
widespread aridity (for this was the dry season)
are eastern. I saw many flocks of goats
herded by the solitary shepherd in the truly
old-fashioned way. Then, a slow-moving team
of oxen followed by a peon guiding a one-handled,
wooden plough deepens the picture.
How powerful must have been the Moorish
influence in Spain, for this is the plough of
Egypt and Chaldea which was carried along
the coast of Barbary into Spain, and left there
as a heritage to the Spaniards who introduced
it into the new world.</p>

<p>Yes, Oaxaca is an El Dorado, a land of treasure
to the searcher after the picturesque. The
real wealth lies in its delightful climate. The
temperature is mild and does not vary more
than twenty or thirty degrees during the year.
The altitude is a little less than five thousand
feet and the air is fresh and bracing. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
also an abundance of good, pure water. Some
day this city will be known as a health resort
for people from cold climates. They will find
relief from the strenuous life in quiet, restful,
oriental Oaxaca.</p>

<p>There is no more picturesque <i>hacienda</i> in
all Mexico than that of Mitla a few miles away.
Because of the bleak and rough nature of the
country it has retained its early characteristics.
The little store is a revelation of the
simple and primitive life of these people.
Evening is sure to find Don Felix, or his black-eyed
son, behind the counter waiting on the
groups of Indians who are constantly coming
in to buy a couple of cents worth of <i>mescal</i>,
or <i>tequila</i>, or cigarettes. One Indian woman
came in to purchase a <i>centavo</i> (one-half cent)
of vinegar, another of lard, and others an equal
amount of honey, soap, sugar or matches.
They would invariably buy only one article at
a time, then pay for it and watch the copper
disappear down a slot in the counter. Outside
the door was an old Indian who had brought
a load of wood down from the mountain, and
the good housewives were noisily bargaining
with him for a centavo’s worth of wood, and
trying to get an extra stick or two for that
sum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Bargaining is a part of the education of
these people. A young Indian came in hatless
and wanted a <i>sombrero</i> (hat). He was shown
one with thirty cents worth of brim by the
merchant. The Indian offered twenty-eight
cents which was accepted and he went away
happy over his bargain. An old Indian,—and
an old Indian is but a child in worldly wisdom,—brought
a large cassava root, which, after
considerable haggling, the merchant purchased
for five cents. He bought a package of sixteen
cigarettes for three cents and told the young
<i>hacendado</i> that he had another “<i>mas grande</i>”
(larger), which he would sell for seven cents.
He went away but returned in a few minutes
with the other root, and looked around at the
crowd with a grin. The merchant took it but
told him it was “<i>mas chico</i>” (smaller), and
he could only allow four cents. The Indian
came down to six and the deal was closed at
five cents, the same price as the first one was
sold for. He bought a glass of <i>mescal</i> for two
cents and vanished in the night air, with a
smile of complete satisfaction on his face. It
is a simple life that these people lead, and the
same scenes may be witnessed any day in the
year at this little <i>tienda</i> at the Hacienda of
Mitla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“When twilight falls, more near and clear,</div>
<div class="verse">The tender southern skies appear.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Twilight is very brief in this land. Scarcely
has the sun dropped out of sight, when the
moon appears on the opposite horizon, almost
a counterpart of the former in its descending
glory. Then the stars appear by hundreds,
and myriads, and the night in all its magnificence
is upon you, where, but a few minutes
before, was the brightness of day. And the
overhanging canopy of the heavens seems so
much brighter, and clearer, and nearer than in
our more northerly land.</p>

<p>As the hour grew late, I wandered forth
from the little store and walked through the
narrow, winding streets of the village. It was
one of those brilliant tropical nights when the
southern skies seemed ablaze with the light of
innumerable stars, and the Queen of the Night
was in her glory. It was such a night as would
have appealed to the astronomers of old. The
streets were silent except for the howling of
some dogs near by. The porch of the <i>hacienda</i>
was crowded with reclining figures wrapped in
their <i>sarapes</i>. A belated traveller came up
and with a sigh of relief deposited his load,
and joined the sleeping crowd. A match illumed
a dark face for a moment as he lit a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
cigarette. Finally, all voices ceased and quiet
reigned supreme. It was a silence as deep and
mysterious as that of the ruined city that lay
but a few rods away.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ISTHMUS OF TEHUANTEPEC</span></h2>

<p>A trip from Vera Cruz to the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec takes the traveller into the very
centre of the tropics in Mexico. It is a most
interesting ride. The entire journey is within
the <i>tierra caliente</i> region and throughout the
whole distance of two hundred and fifty miles
there are only slight undulations that could
hardly be truthfully called hills. It is not all
jungle for there are plains that are sometimes
several miles in width which furnish rich pasture
for great herds of cattle. Here again is
seen the picturesque Mexican cowboy riding
his pony and carrying the ever-present lasso.
The heavy saddles in this hot climate and especially
the twisted bits which are universally
used upon the horses in Mexico seem like a
cruel imposition upon their faithful steeds.
With this combination of rings and bars a
rider could almost break the jaw of a horse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
It is absolutely impossible for an animal to
drink with this bit in his mouth.</p>

<p>This leads me to remark that the finer sensibilities
with regard to the treatment of domesticated
animals and fowls are generally
absent among Mexicans. The poor burros
which are obliged to travel day after day with
great sores on their backs that are continually
chafed by the loads they are carrying, and saddle
mules with similar sores, excite no compassion
from the average Mexican. No doubt
many of these animals are obliged to work for
months and possibly years, when every step
under a load or the weight of a man must cause
them suffering. They are seldom shod, and
many an animal is obliged to travel over the
rough trails until his hoofs are worn down to
the sensitive part. Cruel spurs are jabbed
into his sides until they are raw. I have already
spoken of the bull-fight and cock-fighting.
From a book “On the Mexican Highlands”
I quote another form of cruelty:—“The
stocky, swarthy Indian woman calmly
broke the thigh bone of each leg and the chief
bone of each wing, so that escape might be
impossible, and proceeded right then and there
to pick the chicken alive. She was evidently
unconscious of any thought of cruelty. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
legs and wings were broken in order that the
bird might not run or fly away. The sentiment
of pity and tenderness for dumb things had
not yet dawned upon her mind, and the fowl
destined for the pot received no consideration
at her hands.”</p>

<p>There are many villages along this route
but no cities. Several broad rivers and innumerable
small streams are crossed. The engines
burn wood, and it is necessary to stop
on several occasions and load up the tender
with fuel. At Tierra Blanca are located the
shops and division headquarters of the road.
As the Isthmus is approached the tropical
swamps become more frequent and the train
passes through miles of territory where “still
stands the forest primeval,” a jungle of trees
and shrubs intermingled with countless varieties
of palms; impenetrable forests with creepers
and parasites hanging from the boughs of
trees, and replanting themselves in the moist
earth. Within these jungles the “tigre”
roams and beneath the heavy undergrowth,
horrid, venomous snakes crawl. Overhead fly
noisy parrots and paroquets in couples and
flocks with all of the colours of the rainbow
reflected from their gaudy feathers. Then in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the waters of these streams live hundreds of
repulsive alligators.</p>

<p>At certain seasons of the year the Indians
live almost entirely upon the wild products of
the forest. Nature furnishes fruits, and with
the blow-gun or other weapon enough game
can be killed to fill the larder. With a natural
laziness and in an enervating climate the natives
prefer existence of this kind to the more
artificial one made necessary by labour.</p>

<p>The Vera Cruz and Pacific Railway connects
with the Tehuantepec railway at Santa Lucrecia,
a small village with a poor hotel. Here
it was my lot to be obliged to spend Christmas
Eve and the greater part of Christmas day.
My companions were an Englishman and
a Scotchman. The Englishman rummaged
around in the little store and found a canned
plum pudding, which rather cheered him and
his compatriot and I was invited to share in
their good fortune. However the heavens
seemed to open up and let the water pour down
in torrents and the mud was apparently bottomless
so that our explorations were confined
to the hotel porch. In spite of the plum pudding
my spirits were rather low and I was
reminded of Touchstone wandering in the
Forest of Arden, when he says:—</p>

American coach drawn by an American engine
and run by an American crew bound for the
chief town of the Isthmus and the one that

<p class="caption">THE MARKET, TEHUANTEPEC</p>
</div>

<p>Tehuantepec is a place where some twenty
thousand souls are trying to solve the problem
of existence under favourable skies. In this
city of a hot midday sun and little rain the
strenuous life has few disciples. It is situated
on the Pacific slope of the Cordillera on both
banks of a broad river and only a few miles
from the ocean. It is composed of low, one-storied
buildings, many of which show cracks
that are the result of the earthquake shocks
which sometimes visit here. The streets are
narrow and the centre of the town is the market
plaza. Until the opening of the railroad,
which runs through the centre of the town,
strangers were almost unknown and the quaint
customs, costumes and habits still remain.
The market and the river furnish the only life.
The latter is always made lively and interesting
to the stranger because of the crowds of
bathers in the stream and washerwomen on the
banks. It is an animated scene and has an air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of naturalness devoid of any false ideas of
modesty. These Indians belong to the Zapotec
tribe and they are among the cleanest people in
the world, as a race, as the long lines of bathers
of both sexes from early dawn until nightfall
attest. Woman’s rights are recognized and
undisputed among these people. The women
run the place and do ninety per cent. of the
business. The wife must vouch for the husband
before he can obtain credit. In the market
place where most of the bartering is done
she reigns supreme.</p>

<p>The Isthmus of Tehuantepec is the narrowest
neck of land in Mexico between the two
great oceans and, with the exception of the
Isthmus of Panama, is the narrowest point on
the continent. The soil is extremely rich and
the natural products and resources of the Isthmus
are numerous and varied. All products
indigenous to the tropics grow here. Different
sections, according to elevation, are especially
adapted to the cultivation of corn, cacao, tobacco,
rice and sugar cane. Medicinal plants,
spices, all tropical fruits, vanilla, indigo and
cotton also will grow profitably in this climate.
Cochineal dye has for a long time come from
the Tehuantepec region, but this industry has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
been displaced by the more recent chemical
dyes.</p>

<p>The forests abound in game and the rivers
and lagoons in fish. The forests yield useful
timbers, such as mahogany, also dyewoods and
trees producing gums and balsams. Oil in
paying quantities has been discovered in several
places and the Tehuantepec National
Railway, which crosses the isthmus, is one of
the few roads in the world that uses oil for
fuel. There are also profitable salt deposits.
A great deal of American and European capital
has been sunk in unsuccessful plantations
along this route. This has been due to illogical
and dishonest promotion. The fertile soil will
produce immense crops of the things adapted
for cultivation. With this fact in view it seems
strange to see one abandoned plantation after
another as you journey over the two hundred
miles separating Coatzacoalcos and Salina
Cruz, the two termini of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
trans-continental and inter-oceanic
railroad route. In the matter of climate the
Mexicans claim a great superiority for Tehuantepec
over Panama, because of the strong
winds that blow constantly from ocean to
ocean.</p>

<p>For centuries this isthmus has attracted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
great deal of attention from explorers and
engineers in the effort to discover or provide
the most convenient and economical route between
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Cortez
first realized the necessity of such a route and
explored this whole section in the hope of finding
a natural strait. It is even claimed that
he conceived the idea of a canal across this
narrow strip of land. Failing in these projects
he planned a carriage road from coast
to coast, which was finally constructed by the
Spaniards. Many of the miners who flocked
to California during the gold excitement went
by this highway. Later civil engineers proposed
and advocated a canal by this route even
before the Panama route was seriously considered.
The distance from ocean to ocean is
only one hundred and twenty-five miles in a
bee line. The land is comparatively level and
the rise on the Atlantic side is very gradual
culminating in the Chivela Pass at a height
of seven hundred and thirty feet. From here
to the Pacific the descent is more abrupt. A
ship railway was at one time seriously considered
and liberal concessions were granted by
the Mexican government to the American engineer
James B. Eads and his associates. This
project although considered feasible by engineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
has never been able to enlist capital for
its construction.</p>

<p>The Panama Canal under French control
was a colossal failure. A project which for a
time seemed to promise a solution of the problem
for a quick and economical route between
the East and West ended in lamentable disgrace
and for a long time remained in what one
of our former presidents would have called,
a condition of “innocuous desuetude.” When
the United States undertook this great enterprise,
the completion of this desirable waterway
was placed at ten years or even less. Now
at the end of four years we are credibly informed
that little has been done except the
completion of plans, surveys, purchase of machinery
and necessary sanitation. All of these
preliminaries were essential and will greatly
facilitate the real work when once started.
All loyal Americans believe in the ultimate
successful completion of this great undertaking.
Yet, instead of ten years, we can see that
fifteen years, or even twenty years would be
a more accurate statement of the time necessary
to complete the severing of the two continents.
In the meantime, what?</p>

<p>While other countries have been planning,
the Mexican government with the characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
foresight shown by President Diaz has
been quietly preparing to meet the problem of
a short and economical route between the two
oceans. This has been done without the blowing
of horns and few people were aware until
recently of what was being done and what had
really been accomplished. The government of
Mexico decided upon the plan of constructing
a railway across the Isthmus from Coatzacoalcos,
on the Gulf of Mexico, to Salina Cruz, on
the Pacific Ocean, a distance of one hundred
and ninety-four miles. Most railroads in tropical
lands are narrow gauge but this line is
constructed of standard width and was completed
in 1895. When first opened to traffic
the road was in a very imperfect condition.
In 1899 a contract was entered into between the
government and the English house of Pearson
and Sons whereby the two parties became joint
owners of the road for a period of fifty years
and the net earnings should be shared on an
equitable basis.</p>

<p>The construction was of a difficult character
because the route passed through some cañons,
rocky cuts and a great deal of swampy
soil. The work has been well done and it is
one of the best roads in Mexico to-day, with
good equipment and traffic managed in an up-to-date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and business-like manner. Already
large orders for equipment have been placed
and plans for double-tracking the entire road
have been drawn. The headquarters and general
offices are at Rincon Antonio, which is at
the highest point and has the appearance of a
typical new English town with its red brick
terraces. This town receives the full benefit
of the winds constantly blowing across the
isthmus and enjoys a pleasant and salubrious
climate. The shops and roundhouse for the
railroad have been built at this place also and
the employees are all comfortably housed.
Some of the officers have built very commodious
homes of their own, with every possible
convenience. This town is in marked contrast
with the old Mexican towns and villages along
the route.</p>

<p>The general officers of the road and head
men in the port works at both termini are all
English and Americans. Formerly they were
English, but in recent years the Americans
have been replacing the English, as they have
been found more satisfactory and better
adapted for the work.</p>

<p>The government soon learned that the railway
without good harbours was a poor proposition.
The plans of the government were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
then made to include immense port works and
safe, commodious harbours at Coatzacoalcos
and Salina Cruz. At the former place the
river forms a natural harbour of an average
depth of fifty feet at low water. The only
problem here was to remove a sand bar and
construct piers. The work of removing the
bar has been completed and several large steel
wharves and warehouses have already been
constructed and others are in course of construction.
The total frontage of the wharves
when completed will be over three thousand
feet. It is intended to have a minimum depth
of thirty-three feet alongside of the wharves
which will be equipped with every modern contrivance
for unloading cargo quickly and economically
from ships, and transferring to the
railroad and vice versa.</p>

<p>The work at Salina Cruz presented far
greater problems. It has demanded the maximum
of engineering skill and an immense sum
of money. Here nature had aided in no way
and everything had to be done by human effort.
On account of severe wind storms it was
deemed necessary to construct both an outer
and an inner harbour in order to make a perfectly
safe anchorage at all times and the work
was begun in 1900. The outer harbour is being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
formed by thrusting two massive breakwaters
like immense arms out into the bay with an
entrance six hundred feet wide. The longest
of these breakwaters will be three thousand
feet, consisting of three sections, of different
angles, with the convex sides toward the sea.
The other is only one-half as extensive. The
foundation for these breakwaters is started
thirty feet below low water mark and in some
places is two hundred feet in width. Upon a
rubble foundation immense blocks of concrete
and natural rock are placed at random. Then
on top are placed regular rows of forty-ton
concrete blocks. The amount of material already
used and needed to complete this work
is almost inconceivable. More than three-fourths
of the largest breakwater is already
completed. The inner basin will be wholly
artificial and will occupy in part the site of
the old town of Salina Cruz with an entrance
ninety feet wide. Immense dredges are now
at work on this basin which will be large
enough to accommodate whole fleets of the
largest vessels afloat. From two thousand to
four thousand men have been and are still
employed, the majority being natives.</p>

<p>Although the harbour at Salina Cruz is still
incomplete, this route was formally opened on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
January 23rd, 1907. In the presence of a great
throng of notables, including the representatives
of twenty nations, President Diaz touched
a lever which set in motion a steam winch that
was used to carry the first load of cargo from
a steamer to a freight car. After this car had
been loaded it was transferred to Coatzacoalcos
and the President touched another lever
that set in motion the machinery for unloading
the car and transferring the freight to a waiting
steamer. In this manner was opened a
route that is destined to take a prominent part
in the handling of the world’s commerce, and
which has cost the Mexican government more
than $25,000,000 in gold, and the end is not
yet. After four hundred years the dream of
Cortez has come true and the isthmian highway
is open to the world.</p>

<p>What advantages are claimed for this route?
The benefit to Mexico is self-evident. It will
greatly facilitate the commerce between the
two long coast lines of the republic. This
great undertaking was not begun for the national
trade alone. It is intended to compete
for all that traffic which has heretofore gone
around Cape Horn, through the Straits of Magellan,
or across the Panama railroad. The
Tehuantepec route is one thousand, two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and fifty miles shorter between New York
and San Francisco than the Panama route.
The average freight steamer would require
from four to five days to cover this distance.
The managers of the Tehuantepec National
railroad propose to unload a cargo, carry it
across the isthmus and reload it in two days.
It will probably require one day for a vessel
to pass through the Panama canal. This would
make a net saving of from three to four days
for the Tehuantepec route. The extra cost of
loading and unloading would be made up by
the saving of canal dues and expenses of the
ship for that period. Thus there will be a net
saving of three to four days in shipment, which
might be quite a feature with many classes of
freight. In cheapness of transportation, the
continental railroads of the United States
could not compete. Already contracts have
been made with a line of steamers which have
heretofore run between San Francisco, Hawaii
and New York via Cape Horn to transfer their
freight by this route. The government claims
to have more freight in sight for 1907 than the
Panama railroad has ever carried in a single
year.</p>

<p>This route has been lost sight of in the enthusiasm
over the Panama canal. It will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
completed several years before the canal, and
will during that interim, at least, have a great
advantage over the present Panama railroad
route. The same necessity of transhipment
exists there, but without the fine, safe harbours,
modern and commodious docks, and the quick
loading and unloading machinery with which
the Tehuantepec route is equipped.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Note to Revised Edition.</span> The success of the Tehuantepec
National Railroad has greatly exceeded expectations, and it
was found necessary to double track the entire length of the
road. The improvements at Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos
(now officially called Puerto Mexico) have been completed.
Both cities have been made ports of call for all lines of steamers
passing near. Through Pullman service is now maintained
between the City of Mexico and Salina Cruz. Since writing
the original edition of this book the writer has visited Panama
and gone over the canal route with Colonel Goethals, the engineer
in charge. It is a pleasure to record an appreciation
of this great work, and to know that it will be ready for the
world’s fleets by 1915, and probably a year earlier. There will
still be a wide field of usefulness, however, for the Tehuantepec
National.</p>

<p>Mexico is a land of ruins and the footprints
of former races can be traced all over the
southern half of the country. These ruins
teach us that it must have taken many centuries
to develop the land into the condition in
which it was found by the Spaniards. It was
not only the growth of a long time, but it was
the product of the civilization developed by
many different races and tribes. Otherwise
Mexico would not be filled to-day with a hundred
tribes speaking as many distinct dialects.
There are many ruins of cities extending from
the Valley of Mexico to the remotest corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of Yucatan, and many of them show evidences
of wonderful structures that are the amazement
of even the present generation. Not
buried beneath volcanic lava, like Pompeii and
Herculaneum, yet all are silent cities, for their
inhabitants departed hundreds, perhaps, thousands
of years ago. A few broken columns
now remain where doubtless whole cities once
stood.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of the history of these
cities. The Spanish priests, with fanatical
frenzy, destroyed all of the picture writings
of the Aztecs that they could lay their hands
upon. So many were destroyed, some chroniclers
say, that great bonfires were made.
What light these manuscripts might have cast
upon the history of these early races cannot
even be conjectured. As Prescott says, “it is
impossible to contemplate these mysterious
monuments of a lost civilization without a
strong feeling of curiosity as to who were their
architects and what is their probable age.”
They are undoubtedly very old, and some claim
they are as old as the architecture of Egypt
and Hindoostan. They have marked Eastern
characteristics, as in the hieroglyphical writings
at Palenque, in Yucatan, where are ruins
of a palace and supposed holy city, with many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
sculptured figures of human and animal beings.
The same is true of Uxmal, also in that same
quaint and interesting corner of Mexico. These
writings never have been and probably never
will be deciphered. Then at Palenque can be
traced the outline of the Roman cross which
has greatly mystified antiquarians. We can
only speculate on the origin of these monuments;
whence came the people who constructed
them; and in what period of the
earth’s history they were built; but speculation
proves nothing and convinces nobody.</p>

<p>East of the City of Mexico about twenty-seven
miles lies the village of San Juan Teotihuacan.
Near this hamlet are traces of a
great city covering more than four square
miles, and remains of walls and fortifications,
a part of the wall that still stands being more
than two hundred feet thick and thirty-two
feet high. The most marked features of these
ruins are the numerous pyramids, great and
small, which lie scattered over the plain. Teotihuacan
means “City of the Gods,” and
doubtless these pyramidal structures were a
necessary part of a holy city in the eyes of the
race that constructed them, and were mounds
of worship. Otherwise why would a race build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
such great structures at such an infinite cost
of labour?</p>

<p>The largest of these numerous pyramids is
called the “Pyramid of the Sun,” which has
a base seven hundred feet square, and a
height of one hundred and eight-seven feet.
The next largest is the “Pyramid of the
Moon,” which is one hundred and thirty-seven
feet high, and has a base four hundred and
fifty feet square. At a distance the pyramids
seem rather insignificant, and their outlines
resemble an ordinary steep-sided hill, but on
nearer approach they are better appreciated.
The comparison with the noted pyramids of
Egypt would, at first glance, seem unfavourable,
for the vegetation and vines that cover
the sides rather hide the pyramidal outline.
They were probably higher originally, but the
destructive work of man and action of the elements
have reduced the size. Recent investigation
shows that these pyramids are built in
layers of volcanic rock, cement, pottery and
sun-dried brick. There are five layers—each
layer being a complete pyramid in itself.</p>

<p>It is supposed that on the summit of each
pyramid was a platform which supported great
golden images of the sun and moon respectively,
but no vestige of any such image has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
ever been discovered. If made of gold, and
the Spaniards set their eyes on it, it would not
have remained long. Authorities differ as to
whether the Toltecs, or a race that preceded
them, erected these mighty structures. The
Mexican government has undertaken the work
of restoring the two pyramids, and has appropriated
a large sum of money to carry on the
work. Several hundred labourers are now engaged
in denuding them of the soil and growth
of centuries that covers them.</p>

<p>Near Puebla, and situated in a rich and
beautiful valley, of which mention has been
made elsewhere, is the most noted pyramid in
Mexico—that of Cholula. Legend says that
it was built by a race of giants who intended
to raise it to the very heavens themselves, but
that the gods became displeased and destroyed
them. It is very similar in nature to the Hebrew
story of the Tower of Babel. Because
of its great base, which is more than a thousand
feet on each side, and covers twenty acres,
and has a height of only one hundred and seventy-seven
feet, it looks like a natural elevation
that has been squared in places and levelled
at the top rather than a pyramid. Like
the other pyramids the sides are overgrown
with trees and bushes. Examination shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that it has been constructed of sun-dried brick,
clay and limestone. I quote the dimensions of
two of the most famous Egyptian pyramids in
order that the reader may better understand
the comparative height and base of those and
the Mexican structures:</p>

<p>This valley was sacred in early times. Cortez
says he counted four hundred towers in
the city of Cholula (a much larger city then
than now), and no temple had more than two
towers. Above the city loomed the great pyramid,
on the summit of which stood a sumptuous
temple in which was the image of the
mystic deity, Quetzalcoatl. He had “ebon
features, wearing a mitre on his head waving
with plumes of fire, with a resplendent collar
of gold around his neck, pendants of mosaic
turquoise on his ears, a jewelled sceptre in one
hand, and a shield curiously painted, the emblem
of his rule over the winds, in the other.”
This was the god who drew pilgrims and devotees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
by the thousands from the farthest corners
of Anahuac.</p>

<p>This god was credited with power over rains,
and was appealed to especially in time of
drouth. Bandelier, who made an exhaustive
study of this district, translates an early Spanish
writer as follows: “To this god they
prayed whenever they lacked water, and sacrificed
to it children from six to ten years of
age, whom they captured or bought for the
purpose. When they sacrificed, they carried
the children up the hill in procession, whither
went some old men singing, and before the idol
they cut the child open with a knife, taking
out the heart, and they burnt incense to the
idol and afterwards buried the baby there before
the idol.” Thus it is seen that the Nahuatl
tribe, who occupied this valley, pursued
the same bloody rites as the Aztecs.</p>

<p>The first act of Cortez was to destroy this
temple and erect a Christian church on the
spot, so that spires and crosses have replaced
the pagan towers. All over the valley are
many great churches so conspicuous in comparison
with the humble homes of the natives.
The view from the summit of this ancient
structure is grand and imposing. John L.
Stoddard is inspired by this scene and speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
as follows: “Whatever else of Mexico may be
forgotten, I shall remember to my latest breath
that wonderfully impressive vision from Cholula.
Before me rose, against the darkening
sky, a mighty cross, the sculptured proof that
here Christianity had proved victorious; and
as I lingered, my feet upon the Aztec pyramid,
my hand upon the symbol of the conqueror’s
faith, my eyes turned towards that everlasting
pinnacle of snow, I thought the lesson
of Cholula to be this: that higher, grander,
and far more enduring than all the different
religions of humanity are the Eternal Power
they imperfectly reveal; and that above the
temples, pyramids, and crosses, which mark
the blood-stained pathway of our race, rises a
lofty mountain peak, whose glory falls alike
upon the Aztec and the Spaniard, and in whose
heaven-born radiance all races and all centuries
may find their inspiration and their
hope.”</p>

<p>The Valley of Oaxaca seems to have been
the favourite dwelling place of one or more
of the early races of Mexico. All over the
vales that centre at Oaxaca, and on the surrounding
hills, are ruins of former cities and
palaces that strongly resemble in outline and
decoration the works of the Ptolemies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Pharaohs. Next to Mitla, the most noted ruins
in this valley are those of Monte Alban. The
site of this ancient city is four miles from
Oaxaca on the summit of a mountain, about
eleven hundred feet above the valley. The
ruins extend for a distance of more than a mile
along the ridge, and enclose a great rectangular,
depressed court nine hundred feet long,
and three hundred feet in width. There are
some well-preserved, sculptured stones with
pictorial inscriptions, and images of gods.
Because of its situation, which commands a
complete view of these valleys in every direction,
it is supposed that this place was intended
for defence and a place of refuge in troublous
times. The view from the summit is magnificent
and well repays the traveller for a couple
of hours’ ride on the back of that sadly-wise,
and much-maligned animal—the Mexican
mule.</p>

<p>The village of Mitla is situated about twenty-five
miles southeast of Oaxaca. It is best
visited from that city by coach or mules. We
hired a coach and driver, an unprepossessing
looking outfit, and started on the journey.</p>

<p>“How long will it take?” I asked the driver.</p>

<p>“<i>A las doce</i>,” he replied in idiomatic Spanish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
meaning that we would arrive at twelve
o’clock. As we had started at seven o’clock,
that made it a five hours’ journey.</p>

<p>About an hour’s ride out of Oaxaca is the
village of Tule, where, in the churchyard, and
overshadowing the sacred structure, stands
the famous Big Tree of Tule which deserves
a passing notice. Although not a ruin, it is
a relic of prehistoric days long gone by. This
venerable giant is one of the largest trees in
the world, exceeding in circumference the famous
redwoods of California, and equalling
the largest reported specimens of the gigantic
baobab of Africa. This great tree is one hundred
and fifty-four feet in circumference six
feet above the ground. Twenty-eight people
with their hands outstretched, and touching
their finger tips, can just encircle its great
girth. The height is one hundred and sixty
feet, and the spread of the branches one hundred
and forty feet. It is a species of the
cypress called by the Aztecs <i>ahuehuete</i>. The
great traveller, Humboldt, visited this tree
about the middle of the last century and affixed
a tablet containing his name and an inscription.
As a proof that this old cypress is still
growing, one sees that this tablet is now almost
grown over with bark nearly a foot thick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Tule is a quaint village where the thatched
huts are enclosed by fences of the prickly cactus,
called <i>organo</i>, because of the resemblance
of its branches to the pipes of an organ, and
the lanes are shaded by trees. Underneath the
higher trees grow the orange and lemon, while
the oleander and other flowering bushes add
their brightness to the scene.</p>

<p>After being held up for a road charge of
seven cents by the officials of the village, which
we paid, the driver is allowed to proceed. We
pass through villages with the poetical names
of Tlacolulu and Tlacochahuaya. As the coach
bounces along the rough highway, over the
road on a hillside are seen caves where human
beings live who are literally cliff-dwellers.
Then the valley opens up, and far ahead is seen
San Pablo Mitla a typical Indian village built
around the <i>hacienda</i> of Don Felix Quero, who
is a sort of feudal lord over the neighbouring
peons. Good entertainment is furnished for
the traveller, and it is delightful to rest within
the high walls of this hospitable stopping-place.</p>

<p>The first mention of the ruins at this village
is by a Spanish writer nearly four centuries
ago. His description would not be much amiss
to-day. It is as follows: “We passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
a pueblo which is called Mictlan, signifying
‘hell’ in the native tongue, where were found
some edifices more worth seeing than anything
else in New Spain. Among them was a temple
of the demon, and the dwelling of its attendants—very
sightly, particularly one hall made
of something like lattice work. The fabric was
of stone, with many figures and shapes; it had
many doorways, each one built of three great
stones, two at the sides and one at the top, all
very thick and wide. In these quarters there
was another hall containing round pillars, each
one of a single piece, and so thick that two
men could barely embrace them; their height
might be five fathoms.”</p>

<p>To what purposes were these truly magnificent
structures dedicated? Were they palaces,
temples, tombs, fortresses, dwelling places,
storehouses or places of refuge? Neither archeologists
nor antiquarians have satisfactorily
answered these questions. According to
many of the leading archeologists they are the
most interesting and best preserved ruins in
North America. Here was a great city built
by a race prior to the Aztecs, for that race
could tell the Spanish conquerors nothing of
its builders. The secrets guarded by the huge
monoliths of stone, and the high mosaic-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
walls of Mitla are safe from prying eyes.
Not one city alone stood here, for there are
many remains of walls, columns and huge monoliths
thrown down similar to these, scattered
all over this valley. The best authority says
that they were used for tombs but this could
not have been the only use. They were probably
also used for places of worship, public
purposes, or cities of refuge, or perhaps for
all those purposes.</p>

<p class="caption">HALL OF THE MONOLITHS, MITLA</p>
</div>

<p>A close investigation shows that there are
five distinct groups of the ruins, but some of
them are in badly preserved condition. The
village covers the site of a part of them.
There is a similarity in the structure of all,
as the outer walls are composed of oblong
panels of mosaic forming arabesques and
grecques. At first sight, or at a distance, it
looks like sculptured designs on the walls.
Closer inspection reveals the fact that this
mosaic is formed of pieces of stone accurately
cut and fitted into the face of the walls. These
pieces are about seven inches in length, one
inch in thickness, and two in breadth. The
patterns cannot well be described as they are
so complicated. All the ornamentation consists
of geometrical figures, either rectangular
or diagonal, and differs from all other ruins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in Mexico, in that there are no human or animal
figures.</p>

<p>There is an underground chamber beneath
one of the temples, built in the shape of a cross
with each arm about twelve feet long. The
sides are worked into the same mosaic pattern
as the rest of the walls. It is generally believed
that these chambers were tombs, although
some contend that they were the entrance
to subterranean passages leading long
distances away. If so, the passages were filled
up long ago.</p>

<p>The northwestern group is in the best state
of preservation. One of the buildings here
covers nearly eight thousand square feet, and
has all its massive walls intact with scarcely
a stone thrown down. The characteristic entrance,
consisting of three doors, side by side,
is seen here also, fronting the interior of the
court. The lintels are immense blocks of stone
eighteen feet long, five feet wide and four feet
high. How these immense stones were transported
to this spot and raised without the aid
of machinery, is as great a mystery as similar
accomplishments by the Egyptians. Through
these doors the famous Hall of Monoliths, or
Columns, is reached. This is a wonderful relic
of prehistoric architecture. The six monolithic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
columns, still standing in this room are
each twelve feet in height and almost nine feet
in circumference. They are plain stones having
neither pedestal nor capital and are unique
among the ruins of the world.</p>

<p>Torquemada, an old Spanish historian,
writes of this hall in the following quaint
style: “There was in those Edifices, or
Square of the Temple, another Hall, all framed
around Pillars of Stone; very high and so
thick that scarce might two Men of good height
embrace them so as to touch finger tips the
one with the other. And these Pillars were all
of one piece; and they say that all the Pillars
and Columns, from top to bottom, was four
Fathoms. The Pillars were very like to those
of St. Mary, the Greater, of Rome, all very
well and smoothly wrought.” This hall is
more than a hundred feet long, and twenty
feet wide. These great stones may have supported
a roof formerly but there is no evidence
of it at the present time.</p>

<p>From the Hall of the Monoliths a dark,
stone-covered passage leads into a room called
the Audience Chamber. This is a splendid
room with its walls in carved mosaics, or a setting
of tiles, after the Grecian models. There
are four long, narrow rooms, or corridors, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
either side of this main chamber without other
entrance except the one just mentioned. One
of these, the West room, is most beautiful and
is nearly perfect, as scarcely a tile is broken
or missing from its exquisitely inlaid walls
which at first inspection look like stucco work.
The tiles are so accurately inlaid that no mortar
was used, or needed, to hold them in place.
This is the Corridor of the Mosaics. There
are also traces of a lustrous, dark, red paint,
used on a hard cement plaster. It is quite
probable that all the buildings in the five
groups were as carefully constructed and as
exquisitely ornamented as this one, but they
have been destroyed by succeeding races.</p>

<p>North of this group was another ruin on the
walls of which a Christian church has been
built. Most of the materials used in its construction
came from this old temple or palace.
The sacristy of this church is formed in part
of a portion of the old building, and covered
with a tile roof. This structure was the largest
of all in size, extending over a space nearly
three hundred feet long by one hundred feet
wide, and with walls from five to six feet in
thickness. One room is now used as a stable,
and contains some strange hieroglyphics done
in a lustrous red paint which have never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
deciphered. These are the only semblance to
anything like writing, or historical inscriptions,
that appear anywhere in the ruins. In
the centre of the main court is a hard cement
pavement laid out in the form of a square with
a cut stone border. This may have been intended
for ornament or for human sacrifices.
The latter conjecture might not be erroneous,
knowing, as we do, the customs of those early
Mexican races.</p>

<p>There are many other evidences of ruins near
Mitla. Clay idols, or images, made of terracotta
are found all over the neighbourhood.
Children hunt for specimens and bring them
to tourists for sale. It is also said that many
stone wedges, and copper chisels and axes,
have been discovered here but I did not see
any of them.</p>

<p class="caption">A ZAPOTECO WOMAN</p>
</div>

<p>Who built these ruins? Bancroft, the historian
of Mexico, says that they were built by
the Zapotecs at an early period of their civilization.
The Indians now inhabiting this valley
are Zapotecs and they are a primitive,
simple and harmless race. If these people,
who now dwell in thatch hovels and caves, were
the once proud race that erected these magnificent
structures, then we must say, “How
have the mighty fallen.” What must these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
structures have been in the heyday of their
prosperity that they are now so glorious in
their mellow decay? The famous Palace of
the Alhambra, glorious monument to the
genius of the Moor, is scarcely more magnificent
than these ruins lying here within the
little Indian village of Mitla. The traveller
can give his imagination full play for there is
no written history to destroy the scenes he creates.
He can in fancy re-create these beautiful
structures; people these courts and halls with
royalty, priests or warriors; make the air
vocal with the chants of priests or shrieks of
the victims of human sacrifice; and there is
no one or no record to rebuke him.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">WOMAN AND HER SPHERE</span></h2>

<p>The life and position of woman in Mexico
varies much by reason of the heterogeneous
character of the population. Because of the
absence of a clearly defined middle class it is
a fairly safe proposition to say that there are
but two classes in Mexico, Creoles and Indians.
Creoles include all those who are Europeans
or in whom the European blood predominates.
Domestic life among the Creole class savours
of the East. The ideas with respect to women
are Moorish rather than American. Although
not obliged to appear on the street with face
enshrouded in a shawl or veil, yet the young
woman who has respect for her good name
would not go abroad without the <i>duenna</i>, or
some female companion. Another reminder of
Oriental exclusiveness is seen in the life of the
ladies of the wealthier classes who always
drive in closed carriages even in this land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
balmy air and splendid sunshine and, when
shopping, do not deign to leave the carriage.</p>

<p>On account of the restrictions against the
appearance of women in public, the custom
grew up in Spain and Mexico of allowing them
to use the windows and balconies for observation.
In the cool of the evening the windows
on the streets are opened and women, especially
the young ladies, appear there to watch
the carriages and passers-by and nod to their
friends. The home life and social restrictions
toward women are inherited from Spanish ancestors
who were at one time the aristocracy
and ruling class of Mexico. Nowhere is the
sentiment of home stronger than among the
Creoles. There may be no such word as home
in his vocabulary but the <i>casa</i>, or house, of
the Mexican is his castle and he protects it in
every way from prying eyes. One writer has
expressed his view as follows:—“The intense
feeling of individuality which so strongly
marks the Spanish character and which in the
political world is so fatal an element of strife
and obstruction, favours this peculiar domesticity.
The Castillian is submissive to his king
and his priest; haughty and inflexible with his
equals. But his own house is a refuge from
the contests of out of doors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>In the home the father is absolute lord and
master and all bow to him. There never comes
a time when the children are not subject more
or less to parental authority. Yet, in general,
the sway is so mild that it is readily yielded
to and is scarcely felt. Grown-up sons and
daughters do not forget the respect and obedience
that was expected of them when they were
children. The reverence for parents increases
with the passing of the years. A man never
grows too old to kiss the hand of his aged
mother. The old lady dressed in sombre black
and who looks like a poor relation may be the
one whose wishes rule. Harmony does not
exist in every family and the exceptions are
striking ones. Where quarrels and family dissensions
do occur, the pride and jealousy of
the race renders them the bitterest and fiercest
in the world. These vindictive feuds in families
frequently led to duels and stabbing affrays
to defend personal honour and dignity
in former days. A man and wife will often live
for years beneath the same roof without speaking.
They cannot be divorced but neither will
speak the first word and each rather admires
the grit of the other.</p>

<p>The home life is jealously shielded from
curious eyes. In no place in the world is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
social circle more closely guarded than among
the higher classes in the City of Mexico. The
thick walls, the barred, prison-like windows
and the massive, well-guarded doors prevent
intrusion and perhaps serve to foster this inclination
to lead exclusive lives. Cultured
Americans, unless in the official set, who have
lived there for years have found it impossible
to break into these exclusive circles. Whether
this action is due to jealousy, diffidence, a feeling
of superiority, or aversion to aliens the
fact remains that they are very loth to admit
Americans into the privacy of their homes.
The foreigner has few opportunities of judging
intelligently of the women for they are
immured so closely within the four walls of
their dwellings. Social life in the semi-public,
gregarious ways of American cities is unknown
and would not suit these privacy-loving, domestic
women.</p>

<p>In “The Awakening of a Nation” the author,
Mr. C. F. Lummis, gives a very good
description of the Creole woman: “Always
and everywhere the Spanish-American female
face is interesting; at least as often as in other
bloods it is beautiful. Photographs tell but
half the story, for complexion is beyond them.
But a certain clearness of feature, the almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
invariable beauty of the eyes and fine strength
of the brows seem as much a Spanish birthright
as the high-bred hand and foot. Not even
the Parisian face is so flexible in expression,
so fit for archness, so graphic to the mood.
Yet there is a certain presence in it not to be
unnoticed, not to be forgotten. To no woman
on earth is religion a more vital, ever-present,
all-pervading actuality; and that is why you
meet the face of the Madonna almost literally
at every corner in Spanish-America. And it
is not a superficial thing. There is none to
whom the wife-heart, the mother-heart is truer-womanly.”</p>

<p>The Mexican men are passionate admirers of
the fair sex. Perhaps it is because of the bewitchery
of their black, sparkling eyes. Certainly
it is not on account of the white paste
which is plastered over their faces or the rouge
on their lips. Nor have they added to their
attractiveness by the substitution of the Parisian
hat for the graceful lace mantilla which
lent itself so well to the gentle art of coquetry.
There are many handsome women among the
Creoles but they are not all beautiful as some
writers would lead the reader to infer. They
are bright, vivacious and naturally clever.
They have a quick understanding which only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
needs to be cultivated and perhaps this intelligence
is quicker and more active than that
of the men. They can weave and embroider
with taste and skill. They know a little music
and a little French but, in the American sense,
they are not well educated. The real intellectual
element is wanting and the understanding
is uncultivated. The higher education for
women has not received the stamp of approval
in this land of “to-morrow” and the sex has
not yet become an important factor in the business
or professional world. “If only learned
wives,” says one, “are responsible for that
poor, down-trodden, pitiable specimen of man
called the henpecked husband, then a timid
man would be safe in choosing a Mexican
wife.” The patriarchal element of society in
which man is recognized as lord and master
is still in force among these people. The question
of woman’s rights has never yet agitated
the bosoms of these gentle women.</p>

<p>Domestic freedom in the sense understood
by Americans is absent. The daughters are
closely watched by their mothers who seldom
permit them out of their sight unless accompanied
by some older woman or faithful servant.
Such a thing as permitting a daughter
to have a young man call on her or accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
her to the theatre would never enter the mind
of the Mexican mother. In her estimation the
men do not deserve any confidence until they
are married. The man, of course, thinks that
these precautions are unnecessarily cruel.
Nevertheless mammas think they are essential,
pater familias approves and so the custom
remains. Perhaps it is these restrictions that
are responsible for the reputation the <i>señoritas</i>,
or young women, have of being flirts or coquettes.
They are overflowing with life and
spirits and their black eyes look so full of mischief
that sometimes they seem to be just spoiling
for a flirtation. They are very animated
in conversation and in talking keep time with
hands, knees, shoulders, elbows and face.
Their talk is full of the most extravagant and
seemingly profane expressions.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jesus!” says one girl, “what a fetching
hat.”</p>

<p>“Mary Most Pure,” replies her companion,
“it must have cost five pesos.”</p>

<p>They can stare an American out of countenance
and look him straight in the eye but it
is only a look of curiosity. The social pleasures
resulting from the intermingling of the
sexes that are so common with us are not enjoyed
by them. At a dance the men retire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
one side of the room after a number and the
women take seats on the opposite side. Marriages
among the wealthier classes are generally
made by the parents without consultation
with the principals in an affair supposed
to be of the hearts. After the formal engagement
the intended husband is allowed to call
on his fiancée in the presence of the entire
family and may take her out to the theatre
when accompanied by the mother and all the
female members of the household. Marriage
is a formidable undertaking for the groom
must furnish the entire bridal outfit, in addition
to the house and its furnishings. Two
ceremonies become necessary, too, if the couple
wish to be married by the rites of the church.
The civil ceremony is absolutely essential and
cannot be dispensed with for under the law
this is the only legal marriage. And yet with
all these inconveniences to courtship and matrimony,
bachelors are less numerous than they
are where every facility is granted for love
making.</p>

<p>Love and religion are practically the only
two subjects with which a <i>señorita</i> is expected
to concern herself. She is, probably, not intentionally
or by nature a flirt and she might
scorn to inveigle in her meshes the heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
an admirer, but she cannot refrain from using
her irresistible eyes or entirely avoid the coquettish
use of the indispensable fan with its
wordless telegraphy. The Mexican lover pays
extravagant homage to his sweetheart and a
woman nowhere else is paid such delicate and
elaborate compliments. The Spanish method
of courtship in which the lady is pictured as
sitting at a barred window or leaning from a
balcony to listen to the honeyed phrases of her
lover or the music of his guitar has reached
its highest state of perfection in Mexico.</p>

<p>In the current language of that country a
man who is courting a woman is “playing the
bear.” It is so named from the restless walking
to and fro of the love-stricken youth in
front of the window of his inamorata, in a
manner not unlike a captive bear in a cage.
The same method pursued in the United States
would either result in a man being sent to the
lunatic asylum as suffering from a “brain
storm” or to the workhouse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus25">
<img src="images/illus25.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“PLAYING THE BEAR”</p>
</div>

<p>A young man who sees a young lady on the
street whom he admires, begins by following
her home although it may be days or weeks
before he will venture to speak to her. Having
reached her <i>casa</i> he will begin the <i>hacer
el oso</i>, or “playing the bear,” by walking back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and forth in front of the house or standing on
the street with his eyes fixed upon her windows
or balconies for hours at a time, days and
nights alike. The young lady, if interested at
all, will remain back of the curtain and the
slightest movement of the curtains or blinds
is a sign that she is not entirely indifferent.
After a day or two she may show her face or
wave her hand as a further mark of encouragement,
and after several days she may appear
on the balcony for a few moments. If she goes
to church the lover is probably not far behind
and an occasional smile or glance from her
eyes of midnight is given him as a reward for
his faithfulness. Next come daily salutes and
smiles when the lover appears. Flowers are
sent by the aid of the water-carriers or charcoal-vendors
in which notes are concealed. A
system of wireless-telegraphy communication
is established by means of a fan on one side
and a cigarette on the other. This medium
of communication has been developed until it
has become an elaborate code. Letters become
more and more endearing. When the courtship
has so far advanced that the lovers will
talk, the moonlight nights are all devoted to
the love-making and several pairs of lovers
can be seen on almost any street by the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
home-comer—he on the sidewalk, she at the
window. This courtship frequently extends
over a period of years and the lover who makes
himself so ridiculous sometimes loses the girl
then. Jacob’s seven-year probation has many
counterparts among the Romeos of Mexico.</p>

<p>A young woman of my acquaintance and her
sister recently visited a family in one of the
large cities in Mexico. Like all young women
they soon became interested in the subject of
Mexican courtship and began to sigh for a
“bear.” Every time they returned from a
trip down town a watch was kept from the
window to see if a “bear” followed. At last
one of these creatures appeared and began to
pace in front of the house with his eyes bent
upon the window opening out on the balcony.
Contrary to all precedents and to the surprise
of the neighbourhood, these women could not
resist the temptation to go out on the balcony
on this first occasion. This was such marked
encouragement that the man came day after
day to see <i>las Señoritas Americanas</i> and was
still coming when their visit ended.</p>

<p>American women who have married Mexican
husbands have found the ideas of the two races
so radically opposed that the unions have not
been harmonious. Their verdict is that a Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
man makes an ideal lover because of his
delicate attentions and consideration, but an
unsatisfactory husband since he does not make
his wife a companion and confidante such as an
American woman considers her right and privilege.</p>

<p>The individuality of the woman is not so
completely merged in that of her husband at
marriage as in the United States. The woman
retains her own name but adds that of her husband.
Miss Mary Smith who marries Mr. John
Jones becomes Mrs. Mary Smith de Jones, and
she is not called so exclusively by her husband’s
name. However, when the Mexican
woman is married she accommodates herself to
the station in life provided by her husband.
The wife usually accepts whatever condition
fate has provided for her and bears it with
patience and fortitude. They endure the petty
ills of life with great cheerfulness. They do
not go into society much as custom keeps them
from attending mixed assemblages frequently.
Their world is generally confined to their home,
husband and children. An American woman
would sigh for liberty if compelled to live this
life. The Mexican woman in America shrinks
from the freedom prevalent here and desires
the seclusion of her native land. Families are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
usually large so that home duties require a
great deal of attention. The respect and courtesy
paid by children to their parents is truly
delightful to witness and shows a real goodness
of heart in them.</p>

<p>The mother cannot bear to see her family
separated. She wants them all to stay close
together so that each one can stop in and see
her every day. The mothers are loving and
tender and idolize their boys. It is regarded
as a terrible thing, scarcely to be borne, for
their sons to go out into the world as American
youths do. To go to a distant city is like
being transported to Australia. Even when
they remain near home the mothers are very
solicitous for fear they will work too hard.
On each saint’s day, which is religiously observed,
presents are given and an old-fashioned
dinner, to which all the cousins, aunts
and uncles are invited, is served. In starting
on a journey to a not-distant city, the youth
must visit all his relatives in the neighbourhood
and bid adieu.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice these traits in an
age of growing indifference; but not a little
of the lack of progress in Mexico can be attributed
to this unwillingness to sever home ties.
Many of these young men could do better for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
themselves away from home but a mother’s
pleadings and a mother’s tears keep them at
home. Even after marriage they frequently
continue to live under the same roof.</p>

<p>The religious element enters very largely
into the life of women. Their very names are
a constant reminder of their worship. Many
of them are christened Mary with one of the
attributes of the Virgin or some incident in the
life of the Virgin added such as Conception,
Annunciation, Sorrows or Assumption. Or
there are the attributes such as Mary of the
Sorrows, of the Gifts, Miracles, Tears, etc.
Religion is sustained by the women and you
will seldom see men at the services unless it
is some poor Indian. They are very pious in
their way and attend to their religious duties
with the same interest that they perform
their toilet. The concrete symbols and observances
of the church have a great influence over
them. At mass these pious worshippers always
dress in sombre black. They are very
particular in training their children in the principles
of the Church. Formerly great faith
was placed in the healing power of certain
shrines and relics but this is now dying out
under the advance of modern physicians and
their healing remedies. They are still great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
believers in signs, omens and other supernatural
manifestations.</p>

<p>Above all these women are kind hearted and
charitable. Though carefully guarding their
homes, yet if a stranger is admitted into the
family he is received with a generous welcome.
Should he return after long absence, he is
greeted almost as one of the family and without
reservation. He is not only permitted but
encouraged to call all the members by their
given names and to use the pronoun <i>tu</i> or
“thou” in his intercourse with them. This is
an especial privilege among Spanish people
who are very particular about familiarity in
address. They will oftentimes deprive themselves
for a friend. They have their faults
too. Although smoking is not countenanced in
public it is said that many of them smoke in
their boudoirs and in the company of friends
of their own sex. A great deal has been said
of their lack of morality but this is a subject
upon which only those very familiar with the
facts should dare to speak, for it cannot be
treated lightly, or solely with the intention of
casting a slur on another race.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus26">

<p class="caption">WASHING ON THE BANKS OF A STREAM</p>
</div>

<p>The lives of the Indian women of Mexico
present a far different picture. Instead of living
in great palaces, their homes are in little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
adobe cabins of one room, perhaps without the
luxury of a window, or in bamboo huts covered
with plantain leaves without chairs or table
and only a mat of husks for a bed. There is
no seclusion in their lives and the real duties
of life begin at a very early age. I cannot call
them serious duties for it is doubtful if these
people regard any of the obligations of life as
very serious. Their early experiences are with
its hard realities. They can be seen on the
streets and around their homes with baby
brothers or sisters swung across their backs
when they themselves are so small that the
burden seems far too heavy for them. On the
banks of the streams they can be seen doing
the family washing with a great amount of
rubbing and pounding and wringing. To the
fountains and wells they come carrying earthen
jars on their heads, which they fill with water
and replace with a grace and charm that excites
admiration.</p>

<p>Some of the Indian maids are handsome.
Yet you can tell just what their future lives
will be by observing those of the parents.
They will live in the same squalor, the same
poverty as their ancestors have dwelt for
centuries. They will go through life bareheaded
and barefooted and empty-minded just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
as the generations which preceded have done.
At twenty they have begun to fade and at
thirty they retain scarcely a trace of their
beauty. This is due to hard labour and deprivations.
At fourteen few are unmarried or
at least unmated. The marriage ceremony is
frequently omitted because of the high charges
of the priesthood, yet both parties are usually
faithful. The number of children among this
class is truly marvellous. More than one half
of the younger women when seen on the street
have infant children with them.</p>

<p>No people could be more poorly housed or
more poorly equipped for domestic duties than
these small brown women; and none use the
little they have to better advantage or are more
loyal to the man they call lord and master.
They frequently live and sleep on the bare
ground and possess no more clothing than they
have on their bodies. They will pound away
at the <i>metate</i>, or stone kneading-board, all day
making the <i>tortillas</i> which are both bread and
meat to the peon class. These comely Indian
women will bend their lithe, active bodies for
hours washing clothes on large round stones
which serve as wash-boards.</p>

<p>Their clothes are simple and the latest fashion
has no attraction. The <i>rebosa</i> is a universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
garment and answers for a shawl, a
carry-all for babies and bundles, and a covering
for the owner at night. These black-eyed
women with their half-concealed faces, sober,
unemotional manners, high-coloured garments
and curious Egyptian-shaped pottery might
well be from the shores of the Red Sea. Their
love of warm, bright colours is even seen in
their love for flowers since the many-hued,
brilliant-coloured blossoms are everywhere.
Mignonettes and roses, flowering geraniums
and scarlet poppies, gigantic oleanders and
dainty pansies share attention with the brilliant-hued
tropical birds in gayest colours
which usually hang beside the open door in
a home-made cage of dried rushes. They are
faithful workers in fancy work and will follow
the most intricate design and reproduce it with
fidelity and ease. Their art needle work on
handkerchiefs and other linen articles is extremely
fine and their drawn work is praised
everywhere. It is not the work of the dainty
fingers of educated women but of very humble
and ignorant peon women in floorless cabins of
adobe and of hands accustomed to drudgery.</p>

<p>The women of Tehuantepec are remarkable
for their beauty of face and form. They are
easily the finest looking Indian women in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
America and in beauty of figure will compare
with any race in the world. They are dark-skinned,
almost a soft olive-brown, with sparkling
dark eyes, masses of wavy hair, exquisite
features and beautiful teeth, which are kept
clean and white. Their carriage will attract
attention, for they walk erect and with a peculiar
stride probably due to the prevailing habit
of carrying baskets and water jars always on
the head, where they are carefully balanced.
They are small in stature, with fine limbs, and
seem born models for an artist.</p>

<p>The “Tehuanas” wear a quaint head-dress
called “huepil,” which is made of coarse white
lace. It is arranged in three different ways
according to the occasion. At a dance it is
wound round the neck and stands out like a
huge Elizabethan ruff. In church it is put on
the head something like a Boulogne fish-wife’s
cap. For ordinary wear it is simply laid back
on the hair and the folds hang down the back
resembling somewhat the feather head-dress
of a North American Indian chief. It is indeed
curious but is quite befitting. They always
dress becomingly, with the quaint little
short jackets which expose a section of brown
back above the skirt band and are cut low about
the neck in a fashion that women the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
over have found graceful, and with extremely
short sleeves. On extraordinary occasions this
short jacket, or waist, is of richer material embroidered
in handsome designs of brilliant colours.
Some of the designs show oriental characteristics.
The skirt of the dress is of soft material,
linen or cotton, to the knees and below
the knees is of a heavy lace or embroidery
starched very stiff. The material used is not
the usual cheap and gaudy fabrics sold to the
Mexican Indian, but is of good quality and
specially made by a certain Manchester house
for these people.</p>

<p>These belles of Tehuantepec have a great
liking for American gold coins which are worn
on necklaces. British sovereigns or French
napoleons are usually not desired, but a big
premium will be paid for the eagle, half eagle,
or double eagles of Uncle Sam. Every centavo
that a woman can save goes into her fund for
purchasing gold pieces. The gorgeous necklace
with the gold coins attached makes a showy
and rather beautiful ornament. The fortune
and standing of a “Tehuana” is indicated by
the number of gold coins on her necklace. One
Tehuantepec heiress has—it is said—a necklace
which is valued at three thousand dollars.
The most striking feature in the dress of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
women is that not one will wear shoes. Dressed
in all her finery, head-dress, starched skirt,
polka-dot waist, necklace and smile, she will
appear barefooted—a strange anomaly.
Without shoes they will dance over a stone
floor, or even a dirt, gravel-bestrewn surface,
with a grace that violates all rules of art.
These dusky princesses will be found as graceful
as gazelles on all occasions.</p>

<p>A visit to Tehuantepec will long be remembered
for it is an experience not easily forgotten.
The quaint costumes, the striking
dress, and the proud people combine to make
a memory worth carrying away.</p>

<p>The distinction between the American and
Mexican Indian is not one of colour alone.
There is also a difference in nature. The
American Indian has never been fully subdued,
but the Aztecs were conquered by one overwhelming
blow and their spirit crushed. The
conquest wrought vast changes in the lives of
these people who once roamed over large estates
which they could call their own. The
lands then tilled by their slaves, they themselves
now cultivate for others. Yet they are
a satisfied people, and no one ever hears them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
complain. Though poverty is their lot they are
content, believing that some people are born
rich and others poor, and that this contrast
is in the very nature of things.</p>

<p>Centuries of neglect have not improved
either the moral or physical condition of the
peon, but it has not made a misanthrope of
him. Neither has the fact that he bears no part
in the government made him an anarchist or
filled his pockets with bombs. So long as a
beneficent providence provides present needs
he is supremely content. The mania for the
almighty dollar has not yet entered into his
life so that envy of others does not exist. It
is this envy that makes poverty a menace and
element of danger in our own land. The peon
neither feels shame for his own lowly condition
nor desires pity from others in more prosperous
circumstances.</p>

<p class="caption">A PEON AND HIS WIFE</p>
</div>

<p>Fully one-third of the population of Mexico
are full-blooded Indians and another one-half
are <i>mestizos</i>, those of mixed blood. Many of
the latter and a number of pure-blooded Indians
have reached high positions. A number of the
presidents also, including Guerrero and the
noble Juarez, were pure Indians, and more of
them are representatives of the <i>mestizos</i>. This
is proof that there is no prejudice against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Indians as a race such as the anti-negro sentiment
in the Southern States. These illustrious
examples are, however, the striking exceptions.
Most of them are in about the same
category as the southern negroes,—a race
without ambition. Content to be the servants
of another race they neither court nor welcome
change.</p>

<p>These people make up the great peon class
of Mexico who constitute the bulk of the population.
They are the descendants of those who
were enslaved by the early conquerors. The
Aztecs were an industrious people as the great
structures erected by them, the irrigating
works still in use, and the evidences of judicious
and careful cultivation of every foot of
tillable soil bear mute witness. Poverty was
almost unknown among them and rigid laws
existed against begging. Among some of the
early tribes of Mexico one-third of the land was
divided equally among the able-bodied men in
proportion to the families they had to sustain.
Provision was made by the State for the sick
and other classes of unfortunates. No doubt
the enslaving of these people had a weakening
effect upon their character.</p>

<p>A natural laziness, ignorance and a lack of
interest will probably always keep down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
peon’s efficiency as a worker. The few and
simple wants of his nature and his general contentment
eliminate to a great extent the desire
to improve his condition and accumulate property.
Then, too, the evenness of the climate
and the fact that at all times some crop is being
harvested, thus making it unnecessary to lay
up for an unproductive season, has had its
influence. The labourer is usually given a certain
task for his day’s work. Nothing can induce
him to do more than that task except the
assurance that the excess, or over-time, will be
credited to some future day so that he will get
a longer holiday. These labourers are cheap
and it requires many of them to accomplish
much but there are millions to be had. They
are happy-go-lucky and are unconcerned for
the future. Yet the very fact that they do not
possess self-control and are always willing to
follow a leader who understands how to make
an appeal to their prejudices or fanaticism,
renders this class a serious obstacle to a progressive
government and one that must be intelligently
studied.</p>

<p>The little brown man in the tall, broad-brimmed
hat which seems to give an unusual
height to his sturdy frame is a picturesque
figure and the landscape is not complete without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
him. In the presence of strangers his face
is solemn, but among others of his own kind
he is gay and light-hearted, his face easily
bursting into smiles. He will wrap his tattered
shawl about him with as much dignity as the
Spanish cavalier his richly-embroidered <i>manta</i>.
The act of lighting a cigarette is a matter of
studied ceremony. He will light a match, and
first offer it to a friend with punctilious politeness.
The recipient of the favour never fails
to return <i>muchas gracias</i> (many thanks),
señor. In fact, this elaborate politeness between
these untidy, ill-clad Indians becomes a
farce-comedy at times. He is polite and never
fails to say <i>con permiso</i> (with your permission)
if he is obliged to pass by another person,
whether that person be in silks or rags. His
own inferiority is admitted by calling a white
man a <i>gente de razon</i> or “one who reasons,”
as distinguished from himself,—a peon.</p>

<p>The peon is indispensable in Mexico for he
is not only the labourer, but the body servant
as well. In the latter capacity, if he becomes
attached to his employer, he will not think of
his own wants until the master is provided for,
and will be faithful unto death, if necessary.
His wages are always small, but he is satisfied
with the little he gets. Gambling is a natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
trait and he loses or gains with a stoicism
worthy of greater things. His money is likewise
spent freely at the pulque shop so that his
finances are never embarrassed by a surplus.
A little money will make him very full of liquor,
and a little liquor will sometimes make him a
bad man to handle.</p>

<p>The tenacity with which these people cling
to an environment is a most notable trait. The
peon is a lover of locality. Seldom can these
Indians be induced to go away from their accustomed
habitations. It is this trait that has
made peonage an easy system to maintain in
Mexico. They do not apply much intelligence
to their work. Scratching the surface of the
soil with a crooked stick is the perfection of
ploughing in their estimation. The peon does
not know and does not care to learn any different
way of doing his work than the one
taught him by his fathers. The possibility of
earning more money by the use of labour-saving
devices does not possess the same attraction
as for the American labouring man.</p>

<p>Peonage, which is a mild form of slavery,
is in force in Mexico. Earning from eighteen
to fifty cents (silver) wages per day and improvident
by nature, it is only natural for the
peon to want at some time a little more money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
than that earned. An unscrupulous employer
can easily involve the poor, ignorant Indian in
a net of debt. After a while a debt of $50 to
$100 has accumulated and the worker is in
bondage until this amount is paid. It is an
impossible sum for him to save out of his small
wages, for live he must and support a family,
which is usually large. The price of freedom
is the total amount of the debt. Until that is
paid the law compels him to work for his creditor,
but he is free to get some one else to advance
this money and change masters. He cannot
be separated from his family, nor compelled
to leave the plantation on which the debt
was incurred without his consent. The owner
may, however, sell the plantation and transfer
the debt to his successor, and the peon must
serve the new master under the same conditions.</p>

<p>On the immense <i>haciendas</i> of the uplands the
peons are almost as much of a fixture as the
buildings themselves. It is a strange adaptation
of the old feudal relation and the idea of
changing their abode never occurs to them.
They were born in debt, always remain in that
condition, and transmit the same burden to
their posterity. This condition is usually entered
into voluntarily by the Indians, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
in the beginning he has only himself to blame.
An Indian who desires work will apply to the
manager of a plantation or ranch for a retainer
which seldom exceeds thirty dollars.
He then signs a contract which binds himself,
his family and his posterity to work until this
advance is liquidated. Only a small part of
the weekly wages may be applied on the debt,
and it is tacitly understood that the debt may
be increased after a time. The employer is
obliged to furnish medical assistance free in
case of sickness, and to advance the necessary
fees for marriage, baptisms, confirmations
and burials. Furthermore, whenever overtaken
by old age and no longer able to work,
the peon must be taken care of and furnished
the necessities of life.</p>

<p>Holidays, feast-days and saint-days are
many, and the peon insists on celebrating them
all. Whether he understands much of the ritual
and doctrines of the Catholic Church or
not, he understands full well the meaning of a
feast-day or “<i>fiesta</i>” for on that day he rests
from his labours. It would not be patriotic
to work on a national holiday (and they are
numerous) so he abstains from labour on these
occasions. Sundays are rest days and it generally
requires Monday to recuperate from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
effects of the <i>pulque</i> or <i>tequila</i> imbibed on that
day. Then as each person has a patron saint,
he insists on celebrating the saint-days of the
master, mistress and each one of their family,
of his own family, his father, mother, his wife’s
father and mother, and, last, but not least, his
own saint-day. Then each marriage, birth
or death in the family gives occasion for another
off-day. After this list is gone through
with there remains only about two hundred
working days for the average labourer. The
peon is a philosopher. Knowing that it was
a curse that man should earn his bread by the
sweat of his brow, he tries to avoid as much
of the curse as possible.</p>

<p>The system of peonage or contract labour
in the tropics is revolting and often inhuman.
The peon of the hot country is more independent,
is fond of social life and is not so
industrious as his brother in the uplands.
Hence it becomes necessary to transport hundreds
of labourers for work on tropical plantations.
These are secured through contract
agents who make this work a business. These
agents pick them up over the country and deliver
them in hundred lots to the plantation
managers. The contractor advances from
thirty to fifty dollars in silver to each labourer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and this amount together with his own fee, is
then charged up against the peon who has contracted
to work six months at perhaps fifty
cents per day in the same white metal. The
plantation manager binds himself to furnish
rations, which usually consist of little more
than <i>tortillas</i> (unleavened corn cakes), beans
and rice and a little meat for Sunday, and a
big palm hut will furnish accommodation for
fifty or more men. But little space is allowed
each worker, and here he spends all his time
when not at work, for these contract men are,
on many plantations, kept under guard night
and day by armed overseers. Many of these
poor fellows come from cities on the plateaus
and soon fall a victim to tropical fevers. Many
are men who have been convicted of petty offences
and sign a labour contract in return for
the payment of their fines by the contractor’s
agent and consequent release from confinement.
All, however, are treated alike on the
plantations and are worked under the lash if
necessary. At the end of the six months, there
are not many dollars due the poor peon after
deducting the price of the drinks and cigarettes
which he has purchased at the company’s
store. After drawing his money he is likely
to make for the first town and drink or gamble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
it away. Then, not having funds enough to
get home, he is again at the mercy of the contract
agent or plantation owner.</p>

<p>The little brown man with back bent under
a load has a countenance which is as full of
rest and patient philosophy as a modern financier’s
face is of care and wrinkles of anxiety.
It is almost unfair to the simple-minded, patient
and docile peon of Mexico to speak of
him as an Indian for he is at once confused
with the bloodthirsty redskin of the north. He
is a peaceful, if improvident, character, and
is a child in nature. He represents cheap labour
and is one of the great attractions that
brings wealth to Mexico. After a day’s work
he is content to share his little adobe hut with
the pigs and chickens, and can even find room
for the chance wayfarer. A family of three or
four generations, and numbering twenty people,
will live in a hut that would not be considered
a fit habitation for a donkey in the
north. One American writer who was obliged to
seek shelter in one of these huts gives an amusing
account of his experience which shows the
harmony and good-fellowship that exists in
these households between the human and brute
members. “I took an account of the stock
before I turned in, and found there were three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
dogs, eleven cats, seven children, five men (not
including five of us), three women and a dozen
chickens, all sleeping, or trying to sleep, in the
same room, under the one roof. And when I
gave up sleeping, or trying to sleep, and wandered
out into the night, I stepped on the pigs
and startled three or four calves that had been
sleeping under the porch.” So it is not surprising
that a village of fifty huts may contain
a thousand souls.</p>

<p>A cigarette given in proper spirit every day
will more effectually keep his friendship than
a present of a new suit of clothes. The latter
will not be remembered long while the former
keeps the memory ever fresh. They have been
called the best and the poorest servants in the
world. A trusted servant is, however, usually
an honest one. These wholly satisfied people
with whom our essentials are non-essentials
rather disprove the theory that modern civilization
is necessary to true happiness. Will
the peon in the future wearing shoes, eating
prepared breakfast foods and sleeping in a
bed, be any happier than he is now barefooted
and sleeping on a rush mat spread on an
earthen floor?</p>

<p>A constantly increasing number of the peon
class are moving to the industrial centres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Slowly but surely the leaven is working, and
the opportunity for better wages is withdrawing
the labourers from the plantations. The
railroads, the mines and the factories are paying
much higher wages than formerly prevailed,
and find it difficult to secure sufficient
labourers. Only the selected men can fill these
positions for the average peon has not sufficient
intelligence. He has a great imitative
faculty and can learn a task, but is not a success
in an employment that needs the exercise
of reason and judgment. In many lines of
work more is accomplished at less expense by
peons with the rudest methods than by the
use of the latest labour-saving machinery operated
by peon labourers. Education will no
doubt work great changes in the lives and habits
of these people, but this will be a slow
process in this land of “to-morrow.” The
present conditions are interesting to one who
desires to see how the rest of the world lives,
and it will be a long time before the peon class
will change very materially.</p>

<p>There is one class of the Indian worker that
deserves more extended mention. This is that
time-honoured institution called the cargador.
As you meet him at every place throughout
Spanish North America it may be interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to the reader to learn something of his history
and his accomplishments. It is not necessary
to institute a search for the cargador.
At the station you will be besieged by a small
army of them and the hotel entrance may be
blocked by them. When travelling across the
country there is a never-ending succession of
these picturesque characters singly and in
groups. Sometimes the entire family is along.
In such cases the boys, even down to little tots,
carry a small package on their backs and the
wife and girls balance a basket on their heads.
Perhaps all their earthly belongings are contained
in these various bundles.</p>

<p>The cargador of Mexico and Central America
claims an ancient and honourable lineage.
His occupation may be a humble one, but he
can trace his ancestry back to the followers of
that haughty Aztec emperor, Montezuma, or
even to the still older race of the Toltecs. Not
many years ago almost everything in these
countries was carried on the backs of cargadors.
Even now in the City of Mexico the cargador
is an indispensable factor in the carrying
trade, though there are many express and
transfer companies engaged in that business.
In the smaller places of Mexico, in the mountain
districts, and in Central America he holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
his old-time prestige and, with the cargo mule,
monopolizes the carrying business.</p>

<p>The strength of these little, brown-skinned
cargadors is wonderful. Short in stature and
with thin legs and arms they look very insignificant.
They cannot lift a very heavy weight,
but they can make their fairer-skinned brother
cry out in astonishment at the load they will
carry when it is once adjusted on their back.
The average load for a cargo mule is one hundred
and fifty pounds. A cargador will start
on a journey of two hundred or more miles
with such a load and will cover more miles in
a day over a rough mountain trail than a mule.
At the station you will see the little cargador
pick up a heavy trunk that you can scarcely
move and start off with it at a faster pace than
you care to walk. They always move in a peculiar
jog-trot, and can usually keep it up for
a long time. Up and down hill they go at an
even pace, and will average about six miles
per hour. For short distances some cargadors
will carry as great a load as five hundred
pounds, a seemingly impossible burden for so
slender a body.</p>

<p>The strength in the back is a matter of training
extending over many centuries. The Aztecs
had no beasts of burden and the baggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of their armies was always carried by cargadors.
The Spanish conquerors were obliged
to adopt the same methods. Now, although
there are mules and burros in great numbers,
the cargador is still the great burden bearer
and takes the place of the fast freight in the
commerce of those sections away from the railway
lines. A traveller can take his mule and
send his baggage by a cargador, and the latter
will reach the same stopping place each night
and sometimes ahead of the man on the mule.
Many cargadors carry their loads in a frame,
supported by a broad leather band across the
forehead. When thus loaded they cannot turn
their heads and they do not seem to hear well,
so that I have feared many times they would
be run over by the careless drivers. If there
are several together they trot along in the middle
of the road in Indian file. If going on a
long journey they carry along enough tortillas
for the entire trip, and must always be given
enough time to make these preparations. Several
times a day they will stop and make a fire,
prepare their coffee, and eat their tortillas and
fruit if it can be obtained. At night they will
sleep out in the open air under a porch, if possible;
if this shelter cannot be had, then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
will lay themselves down to rest under the brilliant
starlit canopy of this tropical clime.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus28">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A CARGADOR</p>
</div>

<p>Many of the Indians are very swift runners.
An instance is told in Guatemala of a runner
who carried a dispatch one hundred and five
miles into the interior and returned with an
answer in thirty-six hours, making the trip
over mountains and a rough trail at an average
speed of six miles an hour, including stops
and delays. It is said that fish caught at Vera
Cruz in the evening were served at the dinner
table of Montezuma the following day at his
capital near the site of the present City of
Mexico, a distance of nearly three hundred
miles by road. This was done by a system of
relay runners stationed about a mile apart,
and they made almost as fast time as the railway
train to-day. Whether this is true or not
it is well known that the Aztecs had a wonderful
system of communication. The Spaniards
were frequently astonished at the rapidity with
which the news of their movements was spread.
These runners were trained to great speed and
endurance from their youth. Hundreds of
them were in constant use, and the Aztec emperors
were kept in communication with all
parts of their empire. The Aztecs also used
these runners as spies and they thus took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
place of scouting parties in present-day campaigns.</p>

<p>So it is that these cargadors come and go.
Each generation is like the last. They are
happy in that they want but little and that little
is easily supplied. They are contented because
they live for to-day and worry not for the morrow.
They are satisfied to go through life as
the bearers of other people’s burdens.</p>

<p>It is always interesting to know how the rest
of the world lives, but an experience with the
customs and characteristics of a people impresses
travellers in widely different ways.
Mexico is a land of strange customs and strong
characteristics which are deeply interesting to
the sympathetic tourist. “Oh! the charm of
the semi-tropical Spanish life!” says F. Hopkinson
Smith. “The balconies above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
patios trellised with flowers; the swinging
hammocks, the slow plash of the fountains;
the odour of jasmine wet with dew; the low
thrum of guitar and the soft moonlight half-revealing
the muffled figures in lace and cloak.
It is the same old story, and yet it seems to
me it is told in Spanish lands more delightfully
and with more romance, colour and mystery
than elsewhere on the globe.” On the other
hand many matter-of-fact, unsympathetic travellers
see only the impractical ways, annoyances
and inconvenient customs like the writer
who describes Mexico as “A land of lace and
lice and love, of flowers and fights and fleas;
of babies and bull-fights where pillow slips are
open at both ends and where passengers get
off the front end of the street-cars; where keys
often six inches in length are fitted in keyholes
turned upside down and invariably turned
backward; where the weather forgets to change
from day to day and people sleep under the
same bed cover the year around.”</p>

<p>The Mexican has learned the secret of daily
contentment. This is true generally of the
creole class as well as of the peon. The fact
that some seven thousand families practically
own the entire landed estate of the country
does not inspire envy in the bosoms of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
millions. It is a question whether the Anglo-Saxon
and the Teuton can give these people
more than mere mechanical contrivances.
Home does not necessarily consist in an open
fire, drawn curtains and frequent visits of
curious neighbours. Here homes are found
where privacy is respected, family affection is
strong and there is respect for elders, love for
parents and kindly relations between masters
and servants. Such a country is not uncivilized
and barbarous. There may be many odd
and nonsensical customs but a reason can generally
be found for them. When studying the
natives it is enough to know that they are “an
unselfish, patient, tender-hearted people; a
people maintaining in their every-day life an
etiquette phenomenal in a down-trodden race;
offering instantly to the stranger and wayfarer
on the very threshold of their adobe huts
a hospitality so generous, accompanied by a
courtesy so exquisite, that one stops at the next
doorway to re-enjoy the luxury.”</p>

<p>If one has absolutely nothing to do or suffers
from the constitutional ailment of having
been born tired, Mexico is the place for him
to rest. Nor will he be lonesome in the occupation
of loafing for on every bench is a wayfarer
for company. There is no Mexicanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
more pronounced than that of procrastination.
Never do to-day what can be put off until to-morrow
is the revised motto. Nothing is so
important that it cannot wait until <i>mañana</i>
(to-morrow). An American, whom I met in
Mexico, and who had lived there a number of
years characterized the country as the land of
<i>mañana</i>, <i>esperase</i> and <i>poco tiempo</i>, or the land
of “to-morrow” and “wait-a-while.” Time
is idled away. Nobody expects you to be punctual
and you are not censured should you fail
to keep an engagement. In fact, “you will
probably be designated as a bore should you
insist on scrupulously and punctually keeping
all your appointments, for the man who always
meets you on the dot is a nuisance in this southern
land. If you have an appointment with
a Mexican at noon, go at four o’clock in the
afternoon and you will probably find him waiting
for you. Had you gone on time, he might
have been absent. Never be in a hurry, for
constant hustle and bustle are the unpardonable
sins. Respect the native customs and doze
or read for a couple of hours after lunch and
get busy as the sun nears the horizon.” The
Mexican pays a compliment to Anglo-Saxon
push by adding <i>a la Inglesa</i> to an appointment
which is intended to be kept punctually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
or “after the English fashion.” It is impossible
to educate the Mexican to American
methods, so it behooves the foreigner who goes
to Mexico to make up his mind to do business
after the standards of that country. However
lax or disappointing they may be he must remember
that in Mexico his methods are the
strange ones and not theirs, which are centuries
old. In society calls lengthen to visits
and last hours and the hurried five-minute calls
are happily unknown. The longer the stay, the
greater the compliment for it means that the
visitor is enjoying herself.</p>

<p>In a country where, until recently, the purchase
of a foreign draft was an all-day operation
one cannot expect to do business in a very
strenuous way. The people have breathed the
somnolent atmosphere so long that they cannot
be hurried. In fact, in some of the towns, the
buzzards that encircle the town seem to be the
only living creatures actually looking for something
to do, for even the dogs would sneak
down the alley to avoid trouble. And yet in
the face of all this the Yankee drummer arrives
in a town and scarcely takes time to brush the
dust of travel from his clothes before he starts
out to visit his prospective customers. He expects
to round up his orders and take the train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
on the following morning for the next town.
After running against a few <i>mañanas</i> from
day to day without an opportunity to show his
goods he feels about as disgusted as the enterprising
American who, intending to revolutionize
agriculture, took down a large stock of the
latest American farming implements, but after
a year’s effort had made no sale. The salesman
who will succeed is not the one who tries
to introduce the hurry-up methods of his own
land, but the one who adapts himself to the
country and does not attempt to rush things.
It will require days and perhaps weeks to work
a large city.</p>

<p>I met an Englishman in one of these large
Spanish-American towns who was a fair example
of the successful European drummer.
He had made this route for years and was thoroughly
conversant with the language and understood
the ways of the people. His methods
were a good illustration of the reason why
English and German houses have for many
decades controlled trade in Spanish America.
They keep their old men on the route as long
as possible, for a new man will not do much
on his first trip. We stopped at the same
hotel and I had a good opportunity of observing
his business methods. For several days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
after arriving in the town he did nothing but
make social calls on his customers, take them
to the theatre and entertain them in a general
way. During the next few days he invited them
to his rooms to inspect his stock which was
large and varied. Then he began to take orders.
This method seems like a waste of time
but the orders secured were large and well
repaid for the time taken. The American
drummer could not have controlled his impatience
to be on the move and would have made
a failure. Many who drop into Mexico on a
flying trip, jump to the conclusion that the
Mexican merchant is not so shrewd a business
man as the American. They are apt to mistake
the deliberate methods of the Latin race for
poor methods. He consumes more time in
placing his order and there is less rush and
bustle about his store, but an experienced man
will tell you that in the end he drives a pretty
hard bargain for he knows the market price
of the goods and wants the best discounts and
longest credit.</p>

<p>Even the legal customs are peculiar and have
proven decidedly embarrassing to many Americans.
A number of years ago, before railroads
were so numerous, the local officers always
arrested the engineer and conductor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the event that any one was killed, and they
were thrust into jail “incommunicado.” This
means that you are to be incarcerated seventy-two
hours in solitary confinement without bail,
at the end of which time a judicial examination
is given. An American whom I met there
told me of his “incommunicado” experience.
He was arrested because he had witnessed an
affray and was held as witness, in solitary confinement,
but was released by the official after
the judicious use of thirty dollars. Their theory
is that after a man has been kept in confinement
for three days, with only his own
thoughts for company, he is much more likely
to tell the truth than if he had been in communication
with his lawyers, friends and the
reporters all that time. And who can deny the
truth of their claim?</p>

<p>It is always best to keep out of the neighbourhood
of trouble, or get out of it as quickly
as you can if it comes your way, especially if
in the remote districts, for offender and victim
are both liable to arrest and imprisonment.
Most cases are put off from day to day until
one party or the other is weary of the proceeding.
An instance which illustrates this was
related to me by a man who was arrested for
misdemeanour. Knowing the custom prevalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in the courts he hired an attorney to appear
each day for him. When the case was called
the judge would ask “<i>Que quiere</i>” (what do
you want). After the case was explained he
would dispose of it with the simple word <i>mañana</i>.
The other man appeared each day until
disgusted with the procedure and then dropped
the matter. Lawyers charge so much per word
and are paid for each article as it is written.
Mexican notaries are very important personages.
They take the place to a great degree
of the old-fashioned, family lawyer. They are
regarded in much the same light as the family
confessor and are told the family secrets. To
their credit, be it said, that the notary is usually
a man worthy of the confidence placed in
him.</p>

<p>The ceremonial and punctilious politeness of
the Mexican, be he Don or peon, is interesting
and oftentimes amusing. The Spaniard on
meeting a friend on the street will stop and
inquire one by one after the health of his wife,
each of his children and the various other members
of his household and then in turn will submit
to the same interrogations from his friend.
After witnessing such a scene between two men
in silk hats you can turn down a side street and
see a meeting between a poor Indian in rags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and an old withered woman selling lottery
tickets. Removing his tattered <i>sombrero</i> he
bows gravely, and, in the softest of Spanish,
says, “<i>A los pies de usted, señora</i>” (at your
feet, lady). This is done with a grace and ease
of manner worthy of any station in life; and
her answer “My hands are for your kisses,
señor,” is said in the same gracious way
worthy of a duchess. Should you ask the man
for his name he would be sure to add “<i>Su
criado de usted</i>” (your servant).</p>

<p>The Mexicans are very proud and exclusive,
and suspicious of the newcomer. Seldom indeed
is it that an American gains the <i>entree</i>
into their homes but, if he succeeds, they will
be found among the most charming hosts in
the world. This reserve is probably very natural.
The Mexican has been educated in the
strict Catholic schools and is a victim of custom
old as his country, while the American
coming to Mexico is a mercenary, ambitious
person engaged in commercial strife and in the
race for the almighty dollar. Then, the American
is of a more matter-of-fact temperament
and does not appreciate the impulsive nature
of the Mexican. Money does not appeal to him
except for the pleasure of spending it, and no
person is more lavish in the expenditure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
money, if he has it, than a Mexican gentleman.</p>

<p>The Mexican is a home lover and yet there
is no word in the Spanish language that corresponds
to our word for home. <i>Casa</i>, or house,
is the nearest to it and the Mexican always
speaks of his house when he means his home.
The exaggerated conventionalities are often
carried to the verge of the absurd. Perhaps
there may be as much truth in their expressions
as in the polite but oftentimes meaningless
civilities of our own land. An American,
on being introduced to a stranger, will feel
that he has satisfied the etiquette of the occasion
by simply expressing his pleasure in the
acquaintance. The Mexican goes a step further
and presents the newly-made acquaintance
with his house.</p>

<p>“<i>Su casa es numero ——</i>,” he says with a
graceful bow giving the street and number of
his own house, which literally means “your
house is number ——,” and usually adds, “It
is entirely at your disposal; make yourself at
home.” It is simply a polite way of saying
“I am glad to meet you.” Perhaps five minutes
later the incident is forgotten by the giver.
One writer has said that he met fourteen men
at a club in Mexico and was presented with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
thirteen houses. The fourteenth man was unmarried
and not a householder. Occasionally
some one not familiar with the emptiness of
the phrase has presumed on its literal interpretation
and called at one of the houses presented
to him but has been turned away without
the least sign of recognition.</p>

<p>If one expresses admiration for some article
worn by another, he is quickly informed that
the article is “at his disposal.” If you happen
upon a Mexican at the dining hour, he will
probably offer you his dinner. If you decline
it, the occasion requires that you should do
so with polite wishes for his digestion. These
forms of hospitality are derived from Spanish
ancestors and were by them probably copied
from the Moors, after the open hand and open
tent customs of the sons of the desert who
meant these expressions literally. It has an
empty meaning now, for nothing is left but
the words. With all this seeming inconsistency
and insincerity, the Mexicans are exceedingly
kind hearted and will willingly do favours if
approached in the right way; no service is too
great towards those for whom they have
formed an attachment. They will often accompany
the departing guest for a long distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
over hard roads as a mark of courtesy and
friendship.</p>

<p>We are all victims of habit more or less.
But, whereas the American welcomes innovations
and adapts his habits to them, or forms
new ones, the Mexican does not want any
change from the customs of his ancestors. The
expression “<i>no es costumbre</i>,” meaning it is
not the custom, is a final and decisive answer
that does not admit of argument. You might
as well try to change the colour of the native
as his habits. Americans who keep Mexican
servants are for ever running contrary to the
customs or prejudices of their help. For instance
an American woman<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who lived here a
number of years relates the trouble she had to
induce her servant to use a cook stove which
she had imported from the United States. She
refused because “it would give her disease of
the liver.” In all seriousness she believed that
such would be the result and nothing could
induce her to have anything to do with the
new-fangled thing. A peripatetic merchant
came around selling eggs at six for a real. He
refused to sell two dozen for four reals because
“<i>no es costumbre</i>,” as eggs are always sold
at six for a real, an incontrovertible argument.</p>

<p class="caption">MAKING <i>TORTILLAS</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>A household will have difficulty in getting
along with only one servant for it is customary
to employ three or four in a small family and
from twenty to forty in a large house. Each
servant will do his or her own particular work
cheerfully and will move about so lightly and
airily that you hardly know any one is around.
However, ask the man <i>mozo</i> to scrub the floor,
or the cook to make the beds, and you will see
a regretful look of the eye and be met with
the ready answer, “<i>no es costumbre</i>.” Marketing
is a right jealously guarded too, for
<i>es costumbre</i> (it is the custom) and one of the
perquisites of the man servant, since he receives
a small fee from each person of whom
purchases are made. The Indian servants are
not accustomed to beds and want nothing but
a mat to sleep upon. The traveller can see
these in the halls at the hotel if he comes in
a little late. Here these dusky natives sleep
more soundly than do most Americans on the
most luxurious of beds. An American lady
in Oaxaca took pity on her girl servant and
bought a comfortable iron bed for her to occupy.
She then explained to her how the bed
was used. Several days later she asked the
servant how she liked her bed. The girl said
it was fine—to lay her clothes on. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
American woman finally gave up trying to
change the habits of her maid. Servants become
very devoted to their employers and their
attachment is sometimes embarrassing. In
case of a death in the family they immediately
don black and mourn as though the lost one
was a near relative of their own.</p>

<p>The economy of housekeeping and especially
of the kitchen, even among the rich, is remarkable.
The Indian or <i>Mestiza</i> women rule here
and the customs of a thousand years ago are
the customs of to-day. The <i>tortillas</i>, cakes
made of maize, are the bread of the country.
For centuries these dusky women of Mexico
have ground the corn for their daily bread
between two stones, the grains having first been
soaked for several hours in a solution of lime
water. This smoothed, dished-out stone is
called a <i>metate</i>, an Aztec word, and the women
work for hours in beating the softened grains
to a fine paste. Small pieces of the dough are
then worked between the hands, tossed and
patted, and flattened out until very thin. After
this they are thrown upon a flat, iron griddle
over a charcoal fire. They are never allowed
to brown and are without salt or seasoning of
any kind. After becoming used to them they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
prove very palatable and many prefer them
to the ordinary corn bread.</p>

<p><i>Frijoles</i>, or beans, and generally black ones,
are also invariably served and are eaten twice
every day without intermission on the table of
rich or poor. The <i>chili</i>, a pretty hot sort of
pepper, is a favourite dish that had better be
avoided by the Americans, for the ability to
relish it can only be approached by degrees.
<i>Tamales</i> are relished by the Mexican and can
be found for sale in almost any of the markets.
I never see <i>tamales</i> without thinking of the
description given of them by a big Texan in his
bread dialect, in answer to a question from me
as the train was speeding across the mesquit
prairies near San Antonio. “You take cawn
meal, some hawt (heart), livah and a little peppah
and you make a tamahle, suh.”</p>

<p>The use of sacred names or names of great
personages among these people is often astonishing.
The names of Porfirio Diaz, Juarez
and Hidalgo are as numerous as the George
Washingtons among the negroes of the south.
However, when the American stumbles upon a
Pius Fifth, St. John the Evangelist or even
Jesus, in a dirty-face brown man clothed in
rags, it seems a strange incongruity. Talk
with this humble bearer of a sacred name or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
offer him a gratuity, and, as you depart, he will
say, “<i>Vaya usted con Dios</i>” (go, and God be
with you), in such a simple and benign manner
that you almost feel as though a benediction
were following you.</p>

<p>We are told by the early writers that the
Aztecs had few stores, but that nearly all the
trading was done in the markets which were
found in every city, or by the great merchant
princes who traversed the country with their
large army of burden-bearers and retainers,
compelling trade as well as seeking it. It is
interesting to note the description of the market
in the capital in the time of Cortez written
by Bernal Diaz, one of his followers, and the
historian of his expedition. He expresses his
astonishment at the great crowds of people,
the regularity which prevailed and the vast
quantities of merchandise on display. “The
articles consisted of gold, silver, jewels, feathers,
mantles, chocolate, skins dressed and undressed,
sandals, and great numbers of male
and female slaves, some of whom were fastened
by the neck, in collars, to long poles. The meat
market was stocked with fowls, game and dogs.
Vegetables, fruits, articles of food ready
dressed, salt, bread, honey and sweet pastry
made in various ways, were also sold here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Other places in the square were appointed to
the sale of earthen ware, wooden household
furniture such as tables and benches, firewood,
pipes, sweet canes filled with tobacco mixed
with liquid amber, copper axes and working
tools, and wooden vessels highly painted.
Numbers of women sold fish and little loaves
made of a certain mud which they find in the
lakes, and which resembles cheese. The entire
square was enclosed in piazzas under which
great quantities of grain were stored and where
were also shops for various kinds of goods.”</p>

<p class="caption">A MEXICAN MARKET</p>
</div>

<p>This description would answer very well to-day
except as to slaves and feathers. It is to
be regretted that the beautiful feather work
of that race is a lost art. The market of the
capital is located but a short distance from the
plaza and is an excellent place to study life.
The outer portion is occupied by small shops
covered with protecting piazzas but the central
part is wholly occupied by the Indian merchants.
During the morning hours it is so
closely packed that it is almost impossible to
force one’s way through the dense throng of
humanity. The native, squatted on the ground
on a rush mat, with another mat suspended
over him for protection from the fierce sun, and
his stock in trade spread before him, is a picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
worth studying. Many tribes are represented,
as their dress indicates, as well as the
products of many different zones from the
cocoanut of the hot lands to the inferior pears
of the cold zone. The pottery from Guadalajara
can be distinguished from that of Guadalupe
or Aguas Calientes by its colour and
design. Each piece might tell a history of an
art passed down from father to son for countless
generations, for the son usually follows
the occupation of his father. They never think
of changing method of manufacture or design.
It is quite probable that the pottery seen in
the market to-day is the same as that viewed
by Cortez. Many of the vessels are curious
and fantastic in form but always ornamental
in decoration. When one considers that much
of this pottery is made with no tools but pieces
of broken glass and a horsehair, the result is
a marvel. With the hair they trim the top
and with the glass smooth off the rough places.
The pottery market is an important one, for
articles used in the kitchen and on the tables
of the poorer classes are exclusively of this
ware. For a small sum an entire kitchen outfit
can be purchased.</p>

<p>There are few Jewish merchants in Mexico
for the Mexican is even more persuasive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
his mode of selling and his prices are fully as
elastic. In purchasing native articles on different
occasions I tried several dealers in order
to discover whether they had a uniform bottom
price. They would invariably ask at least
twice as much as they were willing to accept.
I found that if one would only show surprise
at the price asked, the question “What will
you give” would immediately follow. They
were perfectly willing to get as much from you
as possible but the lowest price quoted by the
various dealers was almost identical. Some
persons have facetiously characterized Mexico
as the land of “<i>no hay</i>” (pronounced eye)
because it is such a common answer in marketing
and means “there is none.” In fact, the
answer will always be “<i>no hay</i>” or “<i>si, hay</i>”
(yes, I have).</p>

<p class="caption">CANDY BOY AND GIRL</p>
</div>

<p>There are many quaint and curious characters
that one will find around the market place.
The candy man, or, boy, moves around with
noiseless tread crying his wares in a song
which never varies any more than his stock,
which is always the same and arranged in exactly
the same way. His <i>dulces</i>, however, have
merit and it is not necessary to change anything
already good. The <i>evangelista</i>, or letter
writer, is here with a jug of ink and pen on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
little table ready to write a business letter, or
a <i>billet doux</i> flaming with passion and extravagant
phrases for the unlettered lover. On
the corners of the street may be seen the cobblers
ready to cut and fit sandals “while you
wait.” His whole stock in trade consists of a
pile of scraps of sole leather and some leather
thongs, while his only tool is a curved, sharp
knife.</p>

<p>In and out of the crowd the faithful <i>aguador</i>,
or water-carrier, winds his way bringing
the refreshing water to thirsty mortals. He is
not only a very necessary person in this land
of little rain, but is a person of importance
and knows the inner life of the household of
his customers. His costume and water vessels
vary in the different cities but he is the same
honest character who ingeniously carries the
love messages from the “bear” to his inamorata.
After a morning of hard work his faithful
wife brings his dinner of <i>tortillas</i> and <i>frijoles</i>
to the fountain or well, and there he sits
and eats his humble meal while she watches
her lord and master until he has finished.
Later in the day, tiring of his work or feeling
the burden of prosperity as his stock of copper
coins increases, he resorts to the pulque-shop
and there shows his contempt for the beverage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
he has been distributing by imbibing large
quantities of his favourite liquor.</p>

<p>Perhaps in no way is the general superstition
and ignorance of the Indian shown to better
advantage than in their ideas of disease
and medicine. The <i>curandera</i>, usually a
woman, admits having great knowledge of
anatomy and chemistry, and has a pharmacopœia
all her own. The accounts given here
are vouched for by a writer in <i>Modern Mexico</i>
who is a native of the country, understands
these people and is entitled to belief. <i>Aire</i>
(air), when introduced into the system through
blows or unusually forcible sneezing, causes
swellings, sore eyes and nervous tremblings.
It is treated with plasters and bandages and
lotions. When the alimentary canal is obstructed
it is <i>empacho</i>, which means that undigested
food has adhered to the stomach or
the food has formed into balls and marbles
that rattle around inside the stomach or intestines.
This disease demands immediate and
heroic treatment, and a drop of quicksilver
swallowed at a gulp is prescribed and will generally
dislodge it or kill the patient. <i>Tiricia</i>
is indicated by homesickness, melancholia or
insomnia, and is caused by a subtle vapour
produced by the action of the moon on the dew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and is absorbed through the pores. Change of
climate, good company and tonics are a sensible
prescription. <i>Mal de ojo</i>, or the evil eye,
causes the sufferer to fade away or die of inanition,
and is a common disease of children.
Bright attractive objects are hung up to draw
away the attention of the “evil eye.” If a
child is slow in talking, a diet of boiled swallows
is prescribed. One writer positively asserts
that blue and red beads ground fine and
mixed in equal portions have been given to
persons suffering with paralysis, and the sufferers
survived the treatment. The <i>curandera</i>
is also called upon to mix love potions and
poisons that will cause delirium or even insanity
and death.</p>

<p>Another instance is told in the same periodical
of a woman who was very sick with a
disease from the effects of which she was practically
helpless. A <i>curandera</i> had told the husband
to get a white turkey and tie it in the
house and his wife would get well. When the
turkey had failed to cure her an old man <i>curandero</i>
was procured, who promised to make
her well if supplied with plenty of <i>aguardiente</i>
(brandy). Four dollars worth was supplied
him, and four dollars will buy a great deal of
poor brandy in Mexico. The old man laid himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
down on the ground, after filling himself
up with the fire-water, pounded his head and
kept repeating weird incantations which could
be heard a long distance away. This was continued
for several days until the supply of
spirits gave out. In the meantime the patient
had improved somewhat and could use her
arms and body as far as the waist. The shrewd
old man shrugged his shoulders and said, “I
have cured her as far as I can. You will have
to get a <i>curandera</i> to complete the cure.” The
poor woman soon died, because, as the husband
declared, she had been bewitched.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOLIDAYS AND HOLY-DAYS</span></h2>

<p>It is impossible to understand Mexico or the
Mexicans without knowing something of their
feasts and festivals which play such a large
part in the life of these people. In fact there
is very little of the social life in Mexico that
is not the outgrowth of or intimately connected
with the holy-days of the Church. The saint’s
day of each member, that is the day in the
church calendar devoted to the saint after
whom the person is named, takes the place of
the birthday for gifts and family celebrations.
The <i>fiestas</i>, or feast-days, of the church are
very numerous and are pretty well observed,
although business is not entirely suspended.
The church holidays are either different from
those in other Catholic countries or are observed
in a truly national way in Mexico.</p>

<p>To one who enjoys mixing with the common
people and learning their customs, habits and
ways of thinking, in other words, endeavouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to get into their real, inner life, it is a perpetual
delight to visit the cities and villages
on the <i>fiesta</i> occasions and mingle with the people
in their celebration. This association with
a free-hearted, pleasure-loving people on their
gala days unconsciously broadens the views of
a traveller in a new country, and develops a
sympathy which can be awakened in no other
way. The crowds jostle each other good naturedly
and will treat the stranger with respect.
Too many visitors to this country try to judge
everything from the American standard and
find little to commend. They should remember
that Mexico is Oriental rather than Anglo-Saxon,
and that the Spanish-Moorish civilization
is here blended with the Aztec. Such a
civilization cannot be without merit and it must
have some inherent good qualities. If one
wants to understand a country rightly, he must
first try to enter into the lives of the people
and then look at life from their point of view.</p>

<p>It would be impossible within the limits prescribed
to describe all the celebrations in honour
of the hundreds of saints and the numerous
secular holidays. A description of a few
of these occasions, most generally observed,
will give the reader a good idea of the nature
of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Christmas celebrations in Mexico are very
much different from those in the United States.
There is no merry jingle of the sleigh bells in
this land of Christmas sunshine and skies as
blue as those of Naples; and there are no plans
dependent upon whether the day may chance
to be white or green. The few lofty volcanic
peaks, on which alone snow is ever seen, would
not tempt the most enthusiastic tobogganist.
As there are no chimneys, the children need
not sit up at night until sleep overtakes them,
to see Santa Claus descend with his heavy pack
filled with the things that boys and girls like.
Even the time honoured custom of hanging
up stockings is unknown to Mexican children.
Perhaps they enjoy themselves quite as much
after their own fashion as we do after ours.
They have good things to eat, and the beautiful
flowers are so cheap that no matter how humble
the Mexican home may be, it affords a few
sprays of the scarlet <i>Noche Bueno</i>, the beautiful
Christmas plant. Their celebrations are
long continued for they begin nine days before
Christmas and last until the Feast of the
Epiphany on the 6th of January; and this
entire time is one long delightful jubilee.</p>

<p>These celebrations, which begin on the sixteenth
of December and continue until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
twenty-fifth, are called <i>posadas</i>. The word in
Spanish means an “inn,” or abiding place,
and while the celebration, in its origin, was
distinctly religious, it is now only semi-religious,
and has become an extremely gay and
sociable occasion. The <i>posadas</i> are limited to
the cities but, in those places, the poorest as
well as the richest families hold them and they
are a celebration peculiar to this country.</p>

<p>The origin of the <i>posada</i> is in the gospel
narrative of the Nativity. Because Cæsar had
issued the decree that all the world should be
taxed, Mary and Joseph came to Bethlehem to
be enrolled. Mary made the journey mounted
upon an ass which Joseph led. As the shadows
of the night descended, they were obliged to ask
for shelter, and it is no wonder that the request
was not always granted readily and willingly,
but was many times refused during the trip
that is supposed to have taken nine days.</p>

<p>On the last day, having arrived at Bethlehem,
and because the city was so full of people,
they wandered about for a long time without
finding admittance to either private house or
inn. At last, being tired and weary, and because
no room could be secured, they took refuge
in a stable where Christ was born. Therefore,
it is, that in order to celebrate this journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
fully, the <i>posadas</i> begin with the journey
at Nazareth. Each year a house is chosen in
a family circle, or among a group of friends,
and at that house for nine consecutive nights the
festival is held. Or, sometimes, the celebration
will be held at different houses during that
period.</p>

<p>The journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem
and the difficulties encountered on the way, are
represented by the first part of the celebration.
At the appointed hour the guests assemble at
the house which has been chosen for the celebration
on that particular night. Each person
present, members of the family, guests and
servants, is furnished with a lighted candle, and
two and two, they march around the halls and
through the corridors several times chanting
the solemn “Litany of Loretto.” As each invocation
is ended the audience chant “<i>ora pro
nobis</i>” (“pray for us”). At the head of the
procession the figures of Joseph and Mary made
of clay or wax, dressed in gay, incongruously-coloured
satins are borne either in the hands or
lying in a basket. Sometimes these figures are
dressed in brilliant costumes of lace with tinselled
borderings. At each door the procession
pauses and knocks and begs admittance, but no
answer or invitation to enter is given. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the litany is finished some of the party enter a
room while the rest with the figures of Joseph
and Mary remain outside and sing a chant something
like the following:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“In Heaven’s Name,</div>
<div class="verse">I beg for shelter;</div>
<div class="verse">My wife to-night,</div>
<div class="verse">Can go no further.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reply to this is:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“No inn is this,</div>
<div class="verse">Begone from hence;</div>
<div class="verse">Ye may be thieves,</div>
<div class="verse">I trust ye not.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At last, however, the door is opened and all
go in and Joseph and Mary have secured shelter
for the night. The pilgrims are placed on an
improvised altar and some prayers are recited,
though the religious exercises are generally
hurried through in the quickest manner possible.
Sometimes, to make the scene more realistic,
a burro is introduced in the procession to
represent the faithful animal that carried the
holy family in their wanderings. Frequently,
on the last night, in a room, or on the roof, a
kind of stable is arranged in which the figures
of Joseph and Mary are placed with the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
reverence. On this night a figure of the infant
Jesus is also carried. After the litany the party
proceed to have a general good time which is
kept up until a late hour. Occasionally, in the
homes of the wealthy, these entertainments are
on a very elaborate scale and costly souvenirs
are presented to each guest. Everywhere in the
cities is heard the litany of the <i>posada</i>, for it
is celebrated almost universally. It is sung in
hundreds and thousands of homes and the processions
wind in and out of the rooms and round
the improvised shrines. The patios are hung
with venetian lights, and fireworks blaze skyward
in every direction. In the City of Mexico
the <i>posadas</i> are most elaborate among the official
and wealthy families, and the Zocalo plaza
is a bewitching place with its many lights and
the multitudes of children who gather here for
celebration. The clergy are now censuring the
“<i>posadas</i>” because of the irreverent spirit in
which they are celebrated.</p>

<p>In Mexico the <i>piñate</i> takes the place of the
Christmas tree. It is an oval shaped, earthen
jar, handsomely decorated with tinsel and
streamers of tissue paper, made up to represent
curious figures. They represent clowns, ballet
girls, monkeys, roosters, various grotesque
animals, and even children almost life sized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
The jars are crammed full of sweets, rattles,
whistles and crackers. The breaking of the
<i>piñate</i> follows the litany and is an exciting
event, which generally occurs in the patio. It
is suspended from the ceiling and then each
person desiring to take part is blindfolded in
turn, and, armed with a pole, proceeds to strike
the swinging <i>piñate</i>. Three trials are permitted.
Sometimes many are blindfolded before a successful
blow brings the sweets and bon-bons
rattling to the floor. Then there is a race and
a scramble for the dainties. Thousands of these
<i>piñates</i> are broken each Christmas season and
the vendors of them perambulating the streets
with a pole across the shoulders on which are
suspended the grotesque figures, add life and
zest to the season. Then to see a well dressed,
sedate-looking, business man hurrying home
with a grotesque tissue-paper creation of
gorgeous hues with tinselled decorations and
gay streamers under his arms is a curious but
not uncommon sight.</p>

<p class="caption">BURNING AN EFFIGY OF JUDAS AT EASTER-TIME</p>
</div>

<p>Holy week, as the week preceding Easter is
called, is celebrated in an elaborate and truly
original way. The religious processions which
formerly attended these celebrations are now
prohibited by law. During these few days the
bells, organs and choirs are silent, the stores are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
closed and there is a general holiday. As an
evidence that vanity is not entirely absent, on
Holy Thursday it is customary for men and
women to turn out in good clothes and many of
the ladies appear in handsome and elaborate
gowns. Then on Good Friday everything is
changed and the whole country mourns. Sombre
black takes the place of the more brilliant
raiment of the preceding day; downcast eyes
and solemn faces succeed the smiles and coquettish
glances of yesterday.</p>

<p>On Saturday occurs the most grotesque and
curious of all the festivals of the Church. It is
the day on which final disposition is made of
that arch-traitor Judas Iscariot, and the day
is devoted to his humiliation and death. Effigies
of the traitor are hung over the streets everywhere
and all day long men parade the streets
with figures of the betrayer of Christ upon
poles. These effigies range in size from miniature
figures to those of gigantic proportions.
Each figure is made of <i>papier maché</i>, is filled
with explosives and has a fuse which is generally
the moustache. Hundreds of the images
are sold to the children in each city who explode
them with great glee. Judas is represented
with folded hands, arms akimbo, with legs in
running posture and in every conceivable attitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Some of them bear suggestive mottoes
such as “I am a scion of the Devil” and “Let
me give up the Ghost.” Each person must destroy
a Judas.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock as the great bells of the cathedral
in the City of Mexico sound and other
bells follow, the fuses to these effigies are
lighted. The great Judases strung across the
streets or tied to balconies are exploded amid
great rejoicing. Coins representing the thirty
pieces of silver paid to Judas are sometimes
thrown to the crowd from the windows of
wealthy residents or clubs. Every one grows
wild and the little folks become almost beside
themselves with excitement. The bells in the
towers ring out their rejoicings and a peculiar
apparatus gives out a sound which represents
the breaking of the bones of the thieves on the
cross. The crowds also have innumerable rattles
which make a hideous, grating sound intended
to represent the same incident. The
noise of the bells, the explosion of the fire-crackers,
and the shouts of the multitude form
a strange, exciting, ludicrous scene never to be
forgotten. When the last Judas has been demolished,
the excitement subsides and a good-natured
frolic follows.</p>

<p>The national holidays, of which there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
many, are greatly overshadowed by those pertaining
to the Church, and none of them are so
universally observed. Not all the feasts and
festivals of Mexico are of Romish origin. Some
of them are founded upon the remains of Aztec
idolatry, for the priests of the early days with
a wise foresight adopted the same day for feast-days
in many instances. Though these Indians
probably could not tell why, yet they have a
great reverence for the saints whom they worship
after their own fashion. They are delighted
to have more occasions for decorating
themselves and their churches with flowers,
marching in processions, dancing and letting
off rockets.</p>

<p>The <i>Fiesta de las Flores</i>, or Feast of the
Poppies, celebrated in April, is held on the Viga
Canal and was originally a day devoted to the
worship of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, the god
of nature with them. On that day the bloody,
sacrificial rites were suspended and all joined in
this festival of flowers. This <i>fiesta</i> has lost all
its religious significance but it is said to be
celebrated much the same as in Aztec times.
All day long the canal is filled with boats large
and small manned by the dusky natives. Indian
women and nut-brown maids with wreaths of
poppies on their heads and garlands of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
around their necks, sing the songs of the people
and dance as they move along. On the shore
and in the boats the native bands play, and the
broad highway along the banks of the Viga is
crowded with long lines of carriages filled with
the aristocracy of the Capital who have come
out to witness this unique celebration.</p>

<p>Mexico, like each good Mexican Catholic, has
a patron saint who presides over her destinies.
This saint has not only been adopted by the
government in times past, but has been proclaimed
as the guardian of Mexico by the Holy
See, and only a few years ago was duly crowned
as the Virgin of Guadalupe in ceremonies made
memorable by the large number of church dignitaries
present. Her miraculous appearance
came at an apropos time and greatly assisted
in attracting the natives to the new worship.</p>

<p>The Aztecs had long worshipped a deity
called Tonantzin, “Mother of Gods,” who was
supposed to reside on the Hill of Tepeyacac,
now called Guadalupe. Tradition says that a
devout Indian named Juan Diego, who resided
in the village of Tolpetlac, and who recently had
been converted to Christianity, was passing by
this way on the morning of the 9th day of
December, 1531, on his way to early mass.
When at the base of this hill there suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
burst upon his ears a melody of sweet music,
as of a chorus of birds singing together in
harmony. Surprised at this unusual music he
looked up and lo, just above him, rested a cloud
more brilliant than a rainbow and in the centre
of the cloud stood a lady. Thoroughly frightened
he fell to his knees, but was aroused by a
voice which proceeded from the cloud and called
“Juan.” He looked up and the lady told him
to go to the Bishop of Mexico, and tell him that
she wanted a church built on this hill in her
honour. He did so, but the Bishop was loth to
believe this wonderful tale from a poor, ignorant
Indian. A second and yet a third time did the
same vision appear to the pious Juan and make
the same request. On this last occasion Juan
had passed on the opposite side of the hill to
avoid the woman but to no avail. Upon the
report of the third vision the Bishop told Juan
to ask for some unmistakable sign. The lady
appeared again on the following morning and
Juan told her of the Bishop’s request. She told
him to go up the hill and gather flowers from
the barren hillside where they had never been
known to grow. As soon as he reached there
many beautiful flowers appeared in a miraculous
manner, which Juan gathered up in his
tilma, or blanket, and took to the Bishop. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
he had emptied his tilma the image of the Virgin
was found on the blanket in most brilliant
colours.</p>

<p>The Bishop reverently took the tilma and accepted
it as an unmistakable token. He at once
began the erection of a chapel where it had been
commanded. As soon as the chapel was completed,
he hung the tilma on the high altar where
it has remained ever since except for a few
short periods. It can now be seen under a glass
upon the payment of a small fee. Some persons
say that upon examination it proves to be only
a cheap daub upon coarse, cotton material;
others say that it was taken out a few years ago
and examined and they could not find any trace
of paint, but that the colours seemed to stay
there in some miraculous way. Not being permitted
to make a personal examination, I leave
the reader to make his choice as inclination
directs.</p>

<p>From the time of its origin this legend has
had a wonderful and deep influence upon the
Indians. It is even so to-day. Our Lady of
Guadalupe is looked upon by them as their
patron and protector. Coming so soon after
the conquest and appearing on a hill already
sacred to that race, it led thousands to the new
religion. The main church is very large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
imposing with a nave two hundred feet long
and one hundred and twenty-two feet wide, and
cost over two million dollars in gold. The altar
is magnificent and it has a solid silver railing
weighing several tons around the chancel.
There is another chapel connected with the
cathedral church. Back of these is the miraculous
spring which burst forth from the very
spot on which the Virgin stood at her last appearance.
Half way up the hill are some stone
sails erected by a grateful mariner, and on the
top of the hill is another chapel. Back of this
is a cemetery in which Santa Anna and other
noted persons are buried. A beautiful view of
the capital and the Valley of Mexico is obtained
from the top of the hill which well repays for
the exertion in climbing.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“From Heaven she descended,</div>
<div class="verse">Triumphant and glorious,</div>
<div class="verse">To favour us—</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Thus sing the Indians on the 12th of December
of each year. This is the day that has been
appointed for the great “<i>fiesta</i>” in honour of
the Virgin who appeared to Juan Diego. All
others fade into insignificance and are completely
overshadowed by the annual celebrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in honour of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Any one
who happens to be in the City of Mexico on this
date, or a few days prior thereto, should not
fail to take the street car for Guadalupe, a
suburban town about three miles to the eastward.
The route follows an ancient Aztec
causeway which was old when Cortez invaded
this valley. To the merry hum of the trolley,
which seems strangely out of place on this
historic highway, the traveller is carried along.
One does not need to be told that something out
of the ordinary is about to take place. The
streets of the capital and all the roads leading
to Guadalupe are alive with people on their way
to this most sacred shrine. It is said that many
of these Indians tramp hundreds of miles to be
present on these occasions, taking their food
with them and sleeping out in the open air.
Tens of thousands of Indians are present at
each annual celebration and the number is said
in some years to equal a hundred thousand souls
and more.</p>

<p class="caption">CANDLE BOOTHS IN GUADALUPE</p>
</div>

<p>In Guadalupe the streets and plazas around
the famous church are crowded with booths for
the sale of native wares, candles, images of the
Virgin and for the carrying-on of many kinds
of gambling. There are many booths in which
refreshments are served by women in native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
costumes. The viands include cold chicken,
eggs, tamales, <i>frijoles</i> (beans), cakes and
sweets. For beverages you can take your choice
between beer and pulque. A motley assemblage
is present. Indians from the hot lands mingle
with the purer types of the Aztec from the
mountains and table lands. The swarms of
Indians fairly crowd the plaza and streets, some
eating and drinking, some sleeping, some making
love and some whiling away the time with
cards or other gambling devices. All these people,
of course, belong to the peon class. Mingled
with the natives here and there are all types of
Mexicans, and a number of Americans drawn
here by curiosity add variety to the occasion.
The lame, the blind and the halt are there too;
for alms are plentiful and Our Lady possesses
wondrous powers of healing. Many testimonials
to this fact are seen in the little chapel
which shelters the miraculous spring. Hundreds
and thousands carry away with them a
bottle of these healing waters.</p>

<p>A feeling of reverence pervades the sanctuary.
The kneeling figures with bodies motionless and
their eyes and faces fixed upon the high altar,
crowd the floor until it is impossible to move.
One can not help being impressed by this feeling
of reverence pervading the church and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
chapels. Outside it is different; for here the
throng moves around visiting the booths, eating,
drinking and gambling. Indian minstrels play
their weird airs. Beggars cry out to give them
something “<i>por el amor del Dios</i>” (“for the
love of God”). At night the plaza and streets
are one indistinguishable mass of dark, reclining
and slumbering figures wrapped in their
blankets and shawls. The elements are kind in
December for it is the dry season.</p>

<p>The next day after one of these celebrations
I left the capital for Puebla. For many miles
we kept passing Indians singly, in groups, and
whole families together homeward bound. They
followed well-worn paths which were plainly
visible. The trails were narrow and all
marched along single file in regular Indian
fashion. They would stop and look at our train
as it noisily passed by. Perhaps they were
happy in their simple way in the thought that
for one year more, at least, Our Lady of Guadalupe
would watch over and protect them, her
humble worshippers.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A TRANSPLANTED SPORT</span></h2>

<p>The bull-fight as an amusement is the exclusive
property of the Spaniard. It originated
in Spain and has never spread beyond the limits
of Spanish conquest. Perhaps it is this very
exclusiveness that causes them to cling to it so
tenaciously, though legislatures and governments
have made vigorous efforts to abolish
the brutal spectacles. It is, according to a native
writer, a proof of the superiority of the Spaniard,
because “the Spanish men are as much
more brave than other men, as the Spanish bull
is more savage and valiant than all other bulls.”
Rather, it seems to me to be a survivor of the
ancient gladiatorial contests, or fights between
man and beast in the great amphitheatres of
Rome.</p>

<p>I had never before, even when standing
within the historic walls of the Colosseum, been
able to picture in my own mind the scene of the
arena crowded with combatants while the expectant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
multitude filled the seats in tier upon
tier, until I found myself within the great bull-ring
of Madrid. There was the arena, and
round about were the eager throng, a crowd of
fourteen thousand human beings who impatiently
and anxiously awaited the sound of
the bugle which would announce the opening of
the spectacle of blood and brute torture. Then
it was possible to understand how, in an earlier
and more brutal age, the Roman populace
gloated over the combats where the death of
some of the participants was as much fore-doomed
as the fate of the bull who enters the
ring to-day with a defiant toss of his horns.</p>

<p>If popularity is to be judged by the amount
of patronage, then the bull-fight is the most
popular amusement in Mexico to-day. The
national life is permeated with the sport. The
Sunday bull-fight is the topic of conversation
in the capital for the following week. Even the
children indulge in imitations of this favourite
game in their childish way. It is only on Sundays
and feast days that the <i>corrida de toros</i>
occurs. Six days shalt thou do nothing and on
the seventh go to the bull-fight, runs an old
Madrid saying. They probably go on the theory
that a good entertainment is better on that day
than any other. It is useless to argue with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Spaniard or Spanish-American about the
brutality or inhumanity of these spectacles as
they will immediately remind us of the prize-fights
within our own borders which frequently
result in death. This is a gentle hint that we
should clean our own Augean stables before
telling our neighbours what they should not do.
Perhaps it is a rebuke that is not entirely out of
place.</p>

<p>The Plaza de Toros is always a great, circular
building of stone or wood with little pretence
or ornament. It is built for the bull-fight
and for no other purpose. The interior is an
immense amphitheatre, with seats in tiers rising
to the top where the private boxes are located.
These alone have a roof, as all the rest of the
structure is open to the sky. Half the seats are
exposed to the bright sun and the other half
are in shadow. The seats on the <i>sol</i>, or sunny
side, generally cost only about half as much as
those in the <i>sombra</i>, or shady part. The fights
are usually advertised “if the time and weather
permits.” The ring itself is an arena about a
hundred feet in diameter, encircled by a high
board fence with a lower barrier on the inside,
which serves as a means of escape for a <i>torero</i>
who is too closely pursued by the irate bull.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Sometimes a bull will leap over this first barrier
and then an exciting race follows.</p>

<p>An American will not soon forget the first
sight of the full amphitheatre. The scene is
an exciting one and there is a tension of the
nerves in anticipation of what is to come. The
bands play and, if there is any delay, the thousands
of impatient spectators will shout and
yell themselves hoarse. There is usually a
cheer when the president for the occasion and
his companions take their seats. At length the
gates opposite the president are opened and
a gaily caparisoned horseman, called the
<i>alguacil</i>, appears. He asks permission to kill
the bulls. This being granted, the president
tosses him the key to the bull-pen, which he
catches in his hat. He is cheered if he does
catch it and hissed if he fails. The gate opens
again and the gay company of bull-fighters is
announced by the blast of trumpets. These men
arrayed in costumes of red, yellow, green and
blue silks, satins and velvets, glittering with
beads, jewels and gold braid, form a brilliant
spectacle as they march across the arena to
salute the president, after the manner of the
gladiators of old. Every one taking part in this
exhibition appears in this procession, from the
<i>matador</i> to the men with wheelbarrows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
shovels who clean up the arena after each performance.
I said all, but the principal character
himself is reserved until later. After saluting
the president the company march around
the ring to receive the plaudits of the people.</p>

<p>The bull-fight is a tragedy in three acts.
After the company have withdrawn, the door
through which the bull enters is unlocked and
the first act begins with a flourish of trumpets.
The bull rushes out from a dark stall into the
dazzling light, furious with rage and trembling
in every limb. This is an intense moment and
all eyes are centred upon the newcomer. As
he enters, a barbed steel hook covered with
flowing ribbons is placed in his shoulder. The
ribbons indicate the ranch or <i>hacienda</i> from
whence he came. Even the street urchins can
recognize the colours of a <i>hacienda</i> which has
the reputation of producing animals that are
noted for their belligerent qualities.</p>

<p>Startled by the intense light and enraged by
the stinging of the steel hook, the bull stands
for an instant recovering his senses. Sometimes
he will paw the earth, toss the dust over
his back and bellow his defiance. Around him
in the ring are the <i>capeadores</i>, men on foot
carrying red capes, and <i>picadores</i>, men on
horses armed with lances. These latter sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
motionless as statues upon their steeds that are
blindfolded ready for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>After a moment of uncertainty, the bull
dashes either at a <i>capeador</i> or <i>picador</i>. The
former quickly runs to the barrier and nimbly
leaps over, leaving the bull more infuriated
than ever. The horse attracts his attention
next and there is no way of escape for this poor,
old, broken down servant of man. The <i>picador</i>
makes no effort to save his steed, which is blindfolded
so that he may not see his danger, but
simply plants his blunt spear-point in the
shoulder of the brute. Sometimes this will save
the horse, but it does not please the audience
for a certain number of horses must be sacrificed.
More frequently the bull will, with a
single toss of the horns, overthrow both horse
and rider in a heap. The <i>capeadores</i> then hover
around with their cloaks and distract the attention
of the bull from the prostrate rider who is
helpless because of his iron armour. Once I saw
a rider fall on the back of the bull much to the
surprise of both. It is seldom that a <i>picador</i>
is killed, for the bull will nearly always leave
him and chase a red cloak.</p>

<p>Fortunate, indeed, is the horse that is instantly
killed. If able to walk, he is ridden
around in the ring again with blood streaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
from his wounds and trampling upon his own
bowels. Or the poor brute may be sewed up in a
crude, surgical way in order to enable him to
canter around the ring a few more times. Once,
only, in an experience covering several bull-fights
in several countries, have I seen a horse
drop dead from the first blow. The fight is not
complete without the shedding of the blood of
horses, and sometimes the crowd will clamour
for more horses before this act is closed. There
must be enough, for economy in this feature will
place the people in a bad mood. The audience
must be catered to, for if disappointed they are
likely to demolish the ring and tear up the seats
as a method of showing their displeasure. This,
in itself, is sufficient to prove the debasing and
brutalizing influence of this sport.</p>

<p>In the second act the <i>banderilleros</i>, men who
plant the <i>banderillas</i> in the neck of the bull, appear
in the arena. This is the most artistic and
most interesting act in the entire performance,
for great skill is displayed and little blood
spilled. These men come in the ring without
cape or any means of defence and depend
entirely upon their skill and agility for safety.
They are finely dressed and are usually superbly
built fellows with lithe and muscular bodies.
The <i>banderillero</i> takes with him a pair of barbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
darts about two feet long and covered with
fancy coloured paper with ribbon streamers. He
shakes these at the bull, thus provoking an
assault. Then, just when he seems to be on the
bull’s horns and the novice turns his face away
to avoid the scene, he plants the darts in the
gory neck of the bull and steps lightly aside.
These darts re-enrage the bull, who has been
getting rather tired of the whole affair. He
attacks whatever engages his attention. It may
be only a dead horse which he will then tear
open, being aroused to fury by the smell of the
blood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus35">
<img src="images/illus35.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLANTING THE <i>BANDERILLAS</i></p>
</div>

<p>There are usually two of these men and each
plants four darts in the bull’s neck. They must
be placed in front of the shoulder and so firmly
inserted that they will not be shaken out. If
successful in these particulars, then the <i>banderillero</i>
who is a favourite will receive prolonged
applause and a perfect volley of complimentary
comments. Even the <i>matador</i> himself
ofttimes deigns to take part in this act. If so,
he performs the act in some daring and novel
way. They will sometimes sit in a chair and
thus plant the darts, or take a pole and vault
over the bull after placing them. Occasionally
a bull is cowardly and will not fight. Then
“fire” is called for and darts filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
powder which explodes in the flesh are used.
This will cause the bull to dance and skip around
in his agony, which is very pleasing to the audience
and furnishes variety to an otherwise
monotonous exhibition.</p>

<p>The trumpet sounds the last act. This is the
duel,—the death. Everything has been done
with reference to this act. The first two acts
have been intended to madden the animal and
tire him by the violent exercise and loss of blood.
He is panting, his sides heave as though they
would burst, his neck is one mass of blood over
which, as if in mockery, hang the many-hued
darts. The man with the sword would not stand
much show with a fresh and unwearied animal.
This actor is the <i>matador</i>, or <i>espada</i>, and, if
known as one who kills his bulls with a single
stroke of the sword, he will receive great applause
on entering. He steps forward to the
president’s box and makes a little speech, offering
to kill the bull to the honour of Mexico.
Throwing his hat to some one in the seats, (for
it is considered an honour to hold any of his
apparel) the hero advances sword in hand toward
the bull, who, during this by-play, has
been entertained by the cape-bearers again.
He bears in his left hand a staff, called the
<i>muleta</i>, over which is a red flag, and in the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
a keen-edged sword. The flag serves both as a
lure to the beast and a protection to the man. He
is usually pale and always alert, and studies the
animal for a moment to ascertain his disposition.
This can not be prolonged for the audience
will not brook delay. The tension of nerves is
too great. As the bull makes a rush for the red
flag, with head lowered, the <i>matador</i> plunges the
keen blade into the bull’s shoulders up to the
hilt. The bull staggers and dies.</p>

<p>It is wonderful to see how excited and enthusiastic
the crowd becomes when the <i>matador</i> has
made a skilful killing. They rise and cheer
and wave their handkerchiefs. As he passes
around the ring to receive their applause, a perfect
volley of hats, coats, handkerchiefs, and
cigars are thrown toward him. These are tossed
back except the cigars or any money that may
have been included. If the killing has been
poorly made, or in a bungling manner, hisses replace
cheers and boards or chairs may be thrown
instead of hats and cigars. At a fight in Guatemala
City I saw one <i>matador</i> chased out of the
ring, and he did not return again during that
performance. This was done after he had made
three unsuccessful attempts to kill the bull and
had plunged two swords into the poor, tortured
animal without striking a vital spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Then comes the finale. Teams of gaily-decked
mules are brought in to drag out the dead
bull and horses. The bloody places are covered
over with sawdust in order to prevent slipping.
Even before the dead animals are removed, the
two or three <i>picadores</i> appear on other sorry-looking
steeds, even worse than the first ones if
such a thing were possible. The trumpet
sounds, the door flies open and another bull
comes rushing in to meet the same fate as the
first. The play begins again with the same
variety of sickening incidents. Others follow
in regular order until the usual number of six
bulls have been dispatched. The management
is usually very careful not to promise more
than will be performed, for they know the temper
of the audience too well. At a bull-fight
in Madrid, which I attended, the management
had promised ten bulls in its posters but the
tickets only called for eight. After the eighth
bull had been dispatched the end was announced,
but the crowd refused to leave. All over the
vast amphitheatre rang the cry “<i>otro toro</i>”
(another bull), repeated over and over again in
one swelling cadence with ever-increasing
volume. The management was obdurate and the
multitudes left muttering their maledictions.</p>

<p>Formerly gentlemen of the court mounted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the finest horses in the kingdom entered the
arena and fought the bull like the knights of old.
Now the sport has degenerated and is performed
by professionals hired for the purpose. I once
had the opportunity of witnessing a bull-fight
by the Portuguese method. This is the bull-fight
deprived of its disgusting details. It is even
more exciting and dispenses with the killing of
both bull and horses. The men with the red
cloaks are employed just the same but the
men who place the <i>banderillas</i> are mounted on
horses. They are not broken-down hacks, but
magnificent, well-trained animals and good care
is taken that the bull does not make sausage
meat of them. As a further protection, the
points of the bull’s horns are covered with balls
to prevent injury to the horses. Their sport
consists in riding past the bull, and placing the
darts without permitting the bull to touch the
horse. It is a feat that requires great skill and
a steady nerve. After the bull is thoroughly
tired out, a number of oxen are driven in the
ring, the exhausted bull is taken out and another
one brought in to continue the sport. In any
form bull-fighting is bad enough, but if a line
can be drawn between degrees of evil, the
method of the Portuguese is the least to be condemned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Tauromachy has many devotees who follow
the fights in all their features as the base ball
fan watches the sporting page of the American
newspaper. In some places the spectacles are
reported in all their most minute details, even
down to the number of minutes it took the bull
to die after receiving the fatal stroke. The
killing of bulls is a science and there are many
different schools which have been founded by
great masters. A renowned <i>matador</i> receives
as much attention as the champion prize-fighter
in English speaking countries. They receive
great sums of money but are almost invariably
improvident and save little. The fights are not
unattended by danger, for deaths are not infrequent
and serious injuries are a common
occurrence.</p>

<p>Ladies attend these spectacles and seem to
derive as much pleasure as those who are supposed
to be made of sterner stuff. Their black
eyes sparkle with excitement and they shower
their appreciation upon the successful one without
reserve. It is the place for dress as the
opera is in other lands. All the gallantry in the
Spanish nature comes to the front on the way
to and at the bull-fight. The enthusiasm, the
manners, the expressions—all are distinctly
national.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>In Mexico the light on the horizon seems to
be growing brighter, and the beginning of the
end of this brutal and un-American sport is
apparently in sight. It is not in favour with the
present officials in the national capital and in
many of the state capitals. Three of the most
important states absolutely forbid the bull-fights,
and heavy penalties are provided for any
violations of the law. Statutes to prohibit
them have been enacted in the federal district
on more than one occasion, but they have been
as often repealed so great was the popular demand
for them. The best people do not now attend
the performances in the City of Mexico but
this fact has made little diminution in the crowd.
Their places are taken by foreigners resident
there, many of whom are among the most ardent
supporters of the sport. I predict that within
the next decade there will be few states in the
Republic of Mexico that will permit the bull-fight
within their borders. Such action may
curtail a profitable industry and remove a good
market for worn-out horses, but these material
losses will be more than compensated in the development
of those elements of character which
can not be measured by the low standard of
mere dollars and cents.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">EDUCATION AND THE ARTS</span></h2>

<p>Any one who is acquainted with the conditions
existing in Spain or any part of Spanish America
would naturally surmise that education in
New Spain is at a low ebb. What education
does exist is confined to a few. When you know
that districts can be found in Spain to-day
where scarcely ten per cent. of the inhabitants
have mastered the art of reading or writing, it
is not surprising to learn that after three centuries
of the rule of Spanish governors and
viceroys, ninety-five per cent. of the population
of Mexico still remained in profound ignorance.
Learning for the masses was regarded as prejudicial
by those representatives and misrepresentatives
of the home government. One viceroy
voiced this sentiment by saying that only the
catechism should be taught in America. Students
are not likely to go beyond the learning
of their teachers, and these were obliged to pass
examination in only the most elementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
branches. As a natural result, instruction soon
fell into the hands of the incompetent. Teaching
did not attract the bright minds. Those
who cared for scholastic attainments prepared
for the church or law. Others became soldiers
or adventurers.</p>

<p>The first viceroy, Mendoza, was a broad-minded
man and interested in his new empire.
At his death he left a sum of money with which
to establish a university to be open to all classes.
This institution was actually established as
early as 1551.</p>

<p>Very few of the aborigines attained much
culture, although a few of the Aztec nobles were
notable exceptions. Education was in general
left to the church but was neglected by that institution.
The Jesuits, whatever their faults may
have been, were interested in education, and at
the time of their expulsion in 1767 conducted a
large number of colleges and seminaries.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the City of Mexico
was looked upon as a great seat of learning and
a literary centre. Even before the Shakesperian
era of English writers, literature had its beginnings
in that city. Bishop Zumarraga, the
first “Bishop of the Great City of Tenuchtitlan,”
encouraged writers as well as miraculous
visitations such as the Virgin of Guadalupe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Through his efforts, the first printing press of
the new world had been set up in this seat of
ancient Aztec civilization, in 1535, about a hundred
years before one was in use in the British
colonies. A dozen books had been printed in the
City of Mexico before 1550, and almost a hundred
before the close of the sixteenth century.
Some of these were printed in the Indian languages
including the Mixtec, Zapotec, Nahuatl,
Huaxtec, Tarascan and others.</p>

<p>The very first book printed on this first press
bore the following impressive and “elevating”
title: <i>Escala Espiritual para llegar al
Cielo, Traducido del Latin en Castellano por el
Venerable Padre Fr Ivan de la Madalena, Religioso
Dominico, 1536</i>. Translated into English
it means the Spiritual Ladder for reaching
Heaven, Translated from Latin into Spanish
by Father Ivan, Dominican. This book was
written especially for students preparing for the
priesthood, and no copies of it are in existence
so far as is known. The second book was a
Christian Doctrine, printed in 1539 “to the
honour and glory of Our Lord Jesus Christ and
of the Most Sacred Virgin, His Mother.” It
was published in the native language also “for
the benefit of the native Indians and the salvation
of their souls.” A few of the books departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
from a strictly religious character, but
all of them drew deep religious truths from
every event. One of the early books was an account
of a great earthquake in the City of
Guatemala which, as the title page suggests,
should be an example that “we amend our sins
and be prepared whenever God shall be pleased
to call us.” Nearly all of these early books were
written by Spanish priests and members of the
religious orders. The first music of the new
world was printed here also in the old illuminated
style, as well as the first wood-engraving.</p>

<p>The first newspaper in Mexico was the <i>Mercurio
Volante</i>, or The Flying Mercury, established
in 1693. From that time until the present
day, newspapers have existed, but they were so
hampered and restricted in their utterances that
their influence and circulation was small until
long after independence had been proclaimed.
Now there are a great many newspapers and
periodicals of all kinds and descriptions published
in the capital. However, no American
would class them with our own newspapers, for
the reason that they do not seem to have the
“nose for news” of the American journalist.
A Mexican reporter would not think of invading
the sanctity of the home even for a “scoop”
over his competitors. Likewise the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
skeleton is generally safe, which is certainly a
commendable feature. Not one of the many
newspapers published could be classed as sensational
or of the “yellow” stripe. Mexico’s
reading public is comparatively small even to
this day because of the still large illiterate class.
<i>El Imparcial</i>, the leading daily and official organ
of the government, does not have a circulation
exceeding seventy-five thousand, scattered all
over the republic. Its editor is an influential
member of congress. It publishes an afternoon
edition called <i>El Mundo</i> (the world). The
<i>Popular</i> is second in circulation. <i>Tiempo</i>
(times) is the leading Catholic daily. Other
papers are <i>Pais</i> (country), <i>Patria</i> and <i>Sucesos</i>
(events). There are two English newspapers
published in the capital of which <i>The Mexican
Herald</i> is the leading one and is the best newspaper
in the country. It is widely read by both
foreigners and official and influential Mexicans.
There is an illustrated weekly, <i>El Mundo Illustrado</i>,
an agricultural paper, <i>The Heraldo
Agricola</i> and many other periodicals of various
kinds. <i>Modern Mexico</i> is an excellent illustrated
monthly magazine edited in the City of
Mexico and published in New York. It is
printed in both Spanish and English and is
devoted to Mexican interests in general. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of the cities have daily newspapers, but
they are generally inferior and uninfluential
publications. The best paper published in Vera
Cruz could not compare with an American
newspaper published in a little hamlet.</p>

<p>Mexico has produced many writers and some
of them have been very prolific in their productions.
It can not be said that there was
much originality to the early writers when they
departed from historical lines, but there is a
sprightliness and rhythm in their epics that
holds the attention of the reader. The bright
spots in the history of literature for the first
generation after the conquest are made by a
group of Indian writers, bearing the unpronounceable
names of Ixtlilxochitli, Tezozomoc
and Nitzahualcoyotl. These men recorded the
glory of their ancestors in prose and poetry.
Although their Spanish is faulty, their genius is
clear. Bernal Diaz, the early companion of
Cortez and afterwards governor of Guatemala,
wrote from the latter place his “True History
of the Events of the Conquest of New Spain.”
It is a very readable work and a fascinating account
of an interesting country and a primitive
race. The writings of Las Casas have been
much criticised but they deserve mention. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
chroniclers are Bustamente, Alvarez and
Iglesias.</p>

<p>Poetry has always had a leading place in the
literature of Mexico for the Spanish language
is well suited to verse and their love poems have
the highest rank. Some of the modern writers
are better known in Europe than on this continent.
The two leading poets are Juan de Dios
Pesa, called the Mexican Longfellow, and José
Peon y Contreras. The latter is foremost in the
ranks of living poets.</p>

<p>Literary talent is much encouraged by the
government and any one showing marked
literary ability is almost sure to be offered some
government position. An instance of this is
seen in the career of Vicente Riva Palacio, a
well known novelist and dramatist who has been
governor, cabinet member and Justice of the
Supreme Court. Another example was the poet
Prieto who served in the cabinet of several
presidents and died a few years ago. The
Minister of Fomento (encouragement) can issue
deserving books from the government press, if
he so desires, and a number of works, especially
historical treatises, have been issued in this way.
The reason is, I suppose, because the reading
public is not yet very large and a meritorious
book would possibly have only a limited sale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
These conditions are fast passing away. The
drama and the tragic have ever filled a large
place in the life of the Mexican people. A number
of their dramatic books have become well
known in Spanish-speaking countries but have
not been translated into English.</p>

<p>After the struggle for independence, nothing
was done in the way of education until almost
the middle of the last century. The colleges and
schools already established had begun to
languish. Even after that date little was done,
because the church was so occupied in retaining
its own foothold, and each successive government
inherited only a burden of debt from its
predecessors. Juarez had the desire to establish
schools but not the means. Maximilian
would no doubt have promoted education but his
throne was never secure.</p>

<p>The development of the school system is so
recent that it may safely be said to date from
the first inauguration of President Diaz in 1876.
Listen to what this so-called republican despot
says upon this subject, which expresses the attitude
of the present government: “Education is
our foremost interest. We regard it as the
foundation of our prosperity and the basis of
our very existence. For this reason we are doing
all that we can do to strengthen its activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and increase its power. I have created a public
school for boys and another for girls in every
community in the republic. Education is such
a national interest that we have established a
Ministry of Public Instruction to watch over it.
We have learned from Japan, what we indeed
knew before, but did not realize quite clearly,
that education is the one thing needful to a
people; if they but possess it, all other distinctions
are added unto them.”</p>

<p>The educational system has been revolutionized,
it might be said created, within a little more
than a quarter of a century under the guidance
of one man except for a period of four years.
The schools are non-sectarian and the teaching
of religion is absolutely prohibited. “That”
says Diaz, “is for the family to do, for the state
should teach only scholarship, industry and
patriotism.” The schools in the Federal District,
which includes the City of Mexico and
suburbs, and the territories of Tepic and Lower
California, are under the direct control of the
executive. The Federal District alone has nearly
four hundred schools, and a number of fine new
school buildings have been erected in the past
four years after American models. The idea of
a school building without a play ground is
strange to an American, yet in Mexico none,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
except the new ones, have any recreation ground
whatever, and they are housed mostly in the old
church properties that reverted to the government
after the disestablishment. Another
strange idea to the American mind is the separation
of the sexes which is almost universal. The
girls’ schools contain fewer pupils, for the
parents, if possible, send them to private institutions
or employ private teachers. Within the
past year several million dollars was appropriated
by congress for the erection and equipment
of new buildings in the Federal District.
Commissioners have been sent to the United
States to study school systems, and we find their
schools divided very much as our own.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;" id="illus36">
<img src="images/illus36.jpg" width="420" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN AZTEC SCHOOLGIRL</p>
</div>

<p>The schools in the various states are under
their own control, and the number and condition
varies accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In most of them primary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
instruction is compulsory. There are not many
hamlets except in remote mountain regions
where primary schools have not been established,
although in many places greatly inadequate,
if all those of school age should attend.
In the cities, schools for the higher education
corresponding to our own high schools are maintained
at public expense. The English language
is a compulsory study in certain grades, and one
can almost see the time in the future when there
will be two idioms in Mexico. Free night
schools are maintained in some places for the
benefit of those who can not attend during the
day. The duties of citizenship are particularly
impressed upon boys, and some feminine work
is taught to the girls even in the primary
schools. In addition to the government schools,
the churches and private associations support
many schools for pupils of all ages.</p>

<p>Perhaps nowhere are the results of the campaign
for education seen to better advantage
than in the soldiers’ barracks and penal institutions.
The soldiers are mostly recruited from
the Indians and are without education. The
same is true of those who fill up the jails and
penitentiaries. However much they may deserve
their punishment, humane methods prevail.
Attendance upon classes is compulsory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
upon both soldiers and convicts, and instruction
is given in practical morals, civil government,
arithmetic, natural science, history of Mexico,
geometry, drawing and singing. If the prisoner
is studious and obeys the rules of the institution,
he is graduated and given his freedom. This
little insight into a better life has made a good
citizen out of many a former convict, and a better
one out of a soldier who has completed the
term of his enlistment. The native Mexicans are
bright and intelligent, but self-culture is not
common because of natural indolence. The
Indians, and especially the <i>Mestizos</i>, are promising
and quick to learn. Although there are no
accurate statistics, it is estimated that nearly
one-half of the adult population can at least read
and most of that number can also write.</p>

<p>The first college established in North America
was founded in Mexico in 1540 and is now
located at Morelia. The federal government
supports normal schools for the preparation of
teachers, and schools of music, agriculture,
dentistry, medicine, law, mining, fine arts and
trades for both sexes. There are also schools
for the blind and mutes, and reform schools for
incorrigibles. The medical college has had a
greater reputation than any of the other institutions
of higher learning. This college now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
occupies the old home of the inquisition. The
staffs of these schools are generally finely
educated men, and will compare favourably
with the staffs of similar institutions in other
countries.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nacional, or National Library,
occupies a magnificent building that was formerly
a noted monastery. It contains several
hundred thousand volumes, and is a storehouse
of ancient documents and volumes of the
colonial periods. When the monastic orders
were suppressed, more than one hundred thousand
volumes were added to the national library
from these institutions. Although most of their
books and pamphlets were religious works, yet
many of them are extremely valuable and almost
priceless. There are a few books here that
date back before the discovery of America by
Columbus, and many rare old documents on
vellum and parchment. A few of the picture
writings of the Aztecs are also preserved in this
interesting library. The National Museum is a
vast storehouse of the antiquities of the country.
One can wander around through the rooms and
corridors for hours and days and continually
find some new object of interest in the vast
collection of relics of the prehistorical races.</p>

<p>Like all Catholic countries Mexico has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
traditional reverence for religious art. This
love has caused a careful preservation of all the
paintings that have been brought to the country,
and the names of the donors as well. Nearly
every church is adorned with some cherished
painting, most of which are copies of works by
the noted masters held in the great collections
of Europe. However, here and there will be
found a Michael Angelo, a Velasquez, a Guido, a
Murillo or a Rubens. Perhaps the most
cherished canvas in the entire country is a
Titian at the village of Tzintzuntzan on the
shores of Lake Patzcuaro. It is a large canvas
on the walls of a little dilapidated church and
represents the entombing of Christ. The room
that contains it has but one outside opening and
that an unglazed window.</p>

<p>Mexico herself has developed some expert
copyists but few talented artists. One of the
most noted was Cabrera, a Zapotec Indian, who
has been called the Rafael of Mexico. He was
architect, sculptor and painter, and has done
some fine work in each line. Politics has in
times past absorbed too much of the time of the
young men of Mexico so that the arts have been
neglected.</p>

<p>The Escuela National de Bellas Artes, or National
School of Fine Arts, in the City of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Mexico is an excellent institution and is liberally
supported by the government.</p>

<p>Charles Dudley Warner says: “It was a
marvellous time of original and beautiful work
that covered Mexico with churches, and set up
in all the remote and almost inaccessible villages
towers and domes that match the best work of
Italy and recall the triumphs of Moorish
art.”</p>

<p>No one with even the slightest love of architecture
can help but be impressed with the great
variety of design and grandeur of construction
of the churches of Mexico. Though designed
by Spanish architects and retaining the Moorish
characteristics of that period, they are the work
of native workmen and have received some Aztec
touches. On the façades, towers and portals
are designs and figures made by these workmen
which are doubtless Indian legends or traditions
of a prehistoric age. They resemble strongly
those strange symbols of the ancient Egyptians
and Persians. Some of the churches which the
traveller encounters in villages consisting of
low adobe huts fairly overwhelm one with their
splendour. In places a great church will loom
up in the horizon with scarcely a sign of human
habitation near it. Only in the tropics are these
great houses of worship wanting. The danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of earthquakes precluded the building of lofty
structures there, and the priests of the conquering
age, which was the great era of construction,
rather avoided the hot lands for the cooler
plateaus.</p>

<p>The beauty and originality in the churches is
principally in the exterior. This is the reverse
of the architecture in the homes, for there the
outside walls are plain, and skill and ornamentation
are devoted to the decoration of the patio.
The interior is generally quite commonplace,
and a church in one city is very much like a
church in another. The ornamentation of the
exterior is very elaborate and of the rococo or,
as some would call it, the over-done style. However
when looking upon the extreme richness of
detail, one can see and appreciate the beauty
and merits of the style, even if there is a certain
floridness and flamboyancy present. The towers
resemble the towers which are a part of the
mosques in Moslem countries from which the
call to prayers is made by the priests. As Mr.
Warner says: “There is a touch of decay
nearly everywhere, a crumbling and defacement
of colours, which add somewhat of pathos to
the old structures; but in nearly every one there
is some unexpected fancy—a belfry oddly
placed, a figure that surprises with its quaintness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of its position, or a rich bit of deep stone
carving; and in the humblest and plainest
façade, there is a note of individual yielding to
a whim of expression that is very fascinating.
The architects escaped from the commonplace
and the conventional; they understood proportion
without regularity, and the result is not,
perhaps, explainable to those who are only accustomed
to our church architecture.”</p>

<span class="smaller">MINES AND MINING</span></h2>

<p>Humboldt speaks of Mexico as the treasure
house of the world. It is one of the most richly
mineralized regions ever discovered, and has
produced one-third of the world’s supply of the
white metal. Mexico, together with Peru, furnished
the wealth that enabled Spain to build
up her great empire. And many a real castle in
Spain was built with the gold and silver taken
out of these rugged mountains of New Spain.
The thirst for gold became a disease among
Spanish adventurers. The mind of Columbus
was distracted by the sight of natives along the
coast of Honduras, who were wearing pure gold
suspended around their necks by cotton cords,
and he temporarily gave up his voyage of discovery
to search for the source of this great
wealth.</p>

<p>No country can compare with Mexico in the
amount of silver of pure quality that has been
produced. The largest lump of silver ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
found, weighing two thousand seven hundred
and fifty pounds, was discovered by a poor Indian
in the State of Sonora. Because of a dispute
as to the ownership, the crown solved the
question by appropriating the entire amount.
In fact the crown at first claimed two-thirds of
all the precious metals mined which was afterwards
reduced to one-fifth. Some authorities
estimate the amount of silver that has been produced
in Mexico at the enormous sum of $6,000,000,000,
but two-thirds of that sum is probably
in excess of the real value. The Taxco, Tzumepanco
and Temezcaltepec mines date from 1539
but the greatest number of the “bonanzas”
were discovered between 1550 and 1700. Many
of them were located by priests, who, urged on
by a fanatical zeal to convert the natives, pushed
forth into unknown regions, and literally stumbled
upon the rich ore-bearing quartz. The
Spanish viceregal government kept an accurate
account of the silver mined in their red-tape
method, for the royal one-fifth was carefully and
jealously looked after. Mine owners were compelled
to make their reports regularly and correctly.
A reference to these reports shows a
record of almost untold wealth when it is remembered
that this was long before the depreciation
of silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of the bonanza kings makes interesting
reading. They made money so fast that
it was almost impossible to spend it except over
the gaming table, in those days before the invention
of modern surplus-reducing luxuries.
One man, Zambrano, discovered a mine that
made him extremely wealthy. Although he lived
in the various capitals of Europe as extravagantly
as the age permitted, yet he left a comfortable
little fortune of $60,000,000 for his
heirs to fight over. He even proposed to lay a
sidewalk of silver bars in front of his house,
but the authorities objected. He took out fifty-five
million ounces of silver from one mine in
twelve years as is shown by the government
records.</p>

<p>Many of those who accumulated great fortunes
were made grandees of Spain and some of
the present titled families in that country are
descendants of the famous bonanza kings of
Mexico. Juan de Oñata who colonized New
Mexico at his own expense, founding Santa Fe,
and became its first governor about 1598, was a
son of one of the mining kings, and the wealth
dug out of the earth in old Mexico by his father
furnished the means for founding that state.</p>

<p>Joseph de la Borda was one of the romantic
characters of this age. He was a wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Frenchman who came from Canada in the first
half of the eighteenth century and no one ever
learned anything further about him. He made
three fortunes and lost two of them because of
his lavish gifts, most of which went to the
church. He built several large churches in what
is now the state of Hidalgo. After losing his
second fortune, the Archbishop of Mexico gave
him permission to sell a magnificent diamond-studded
ornament that he had given to the
church in Tasco. From this he realized $100,000,
and after a great deal of prospecting,
finally discovered another rich mine which
yielded him many more millions.</p>

<p>Pedro Romero de Terreros, from a humble
shopkeeper, became Count of Regla, after acquiring
great wealth from his mine, La Viscayne.
He built two large ships, one of one hundred
and twelve guns, and presented them to his
sovereign. He also loaned the crown $1,000,000
as freely as a man gives a friend a dollar, which
sum the king never found it convenient to repay.
In later life he founded the national pawn-shop,
which he called the Mount of Piety and which
has grown to be such a great humanitarian institution
in the capital and other cities.</p>

<p>The Conde de Valenciana who discovered the
famous Valenciana mine of Guanajuato is reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to have made and spent $100,000,000 in
a few years. One man discovered a rich mine
on his ranch near Durango that rendered him
immensely wealthy. He sent a present of $2,000,000
to the king of Spain and asked permission
to build galleries and <i>portales</i> of silver
around his fine new home. This was refused
on the ground that such display was the privilege
of royalty only.</p>

<p>A Guanajuato miner paved the street with silver
ingots for a distance of sixty yards for the
procession to pass over on their way to the
church on the occasion of the christening of his
son. Another story is told of a mining king who,
on a similar occasion, paved the main aisle of
the church with bars of silver for the baptismal
party to walk upon. After the ceremony he
wanted to remove the silver bars, but the wily
priest told him that it would be an act of impiety
which the Almighty would surely punish. It
was not done and the occasion proved to be an
expensive christening for the crœsus. Godfathers
became so reckless in throwing away
money that one viceroy issued a proclamation
forbidding them to fling handfuls of money in
the street as had been their custom, because such
acts encouraged improvidence.</p>

<p>I have seen the statement that there is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
man at Mazatlan to-day who owns a mine whose
entrance is protected by massive walls and
gates. Whenever he wants a hundred thousand
or so of lucre, he simply takes in a few miners
and digs out the ore and then gambles it away.</p>

<p>There is one noted mining king of to-day,
Pedro Alvaredo, a full-blooded Indian, who is
known as the peon millionaire. A few years
ago a mine that he owned “bonanzad,” as they
call it, and he became immensely wealthy. However,
he and his wife still dress in the peon
clothes to which they were accustomed. He has
built a mansion and furnished it with every kind
of musical instrument to be obtained, including
many makes of pianos. A few years ago he
announced that he would pay off the national
debt, but he found it a little too large.</p>

<p>The Spaniards worked only the very richest
of the mines. They would not touch ore that did
not yield nearly a hundred ounces to the ton.
Their early methods were of the very crudest
sort until the “<i>patio</i>” process was discovered
and came into general use. If difficulties were
met with in mining, these men simply worked
around them and left great amounts of rich
quartz untouched. The ore was so plentiful
that they did not attempt to do their operations
in a thorough manner. However they protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the entrance by building great fortifications
around the shafts, that look like the walled cities
of old and were patrolled by armed guards.
Vast shafts were constructed down which run
ladders. The poor peon toils up these ladders
which sometimes aggregate more than a thousand
rounds carrying a rawhide sack on his back
containing two hundred and fifty pounds of ore
without a rest, and will make several trips a day.
In early times the natives were compelled to
work in these mines to all intents and purposes
as slaves, and were beaten and flogged even to
death if they refused to obey their taskmasters.
At night each peon was searched for fear he
might conceal some of the precious metal. However
as their costume was exceedingly simple
the search was a very easy matter. The mines
were cleared of water in the same way by the
peons carrying it up these long ladders in rawhide
buckets. Many mines were abandoned on
account of water in those days long before their
wealth was exhausted. Transportation was
slow and expensive, and the mountain trails
were kept dusty by the long trains of pack mules
transporting treasures and supplies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus37">
<img src="images/illus37.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PEON MINERS AT LUNCH</p>
</div>

<p>Until within the last few years since American
capital has undertaken to develop many of
the Mexican mines, only the most primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
methods were in use. Even to-day many are
operated in the same old way, although modern
machinery is being rapidly introduced. The expense
of fuel has been a great drawback in the
less productive mines, and the shafts many hundreds
of feet deep are worked with a windlass
and mule power. Coal costs as high as $15
(gold) per ton at the mine and is then cheaper
than wood at $14 (silver) per cord. At these
prices steam power becomes very expensive. In
those early days only those ores could be mined
at a profit that could be treated at the mine, because
of the great expense of transporting the
ore-laden rock on the backs of mules.</p>

<p>The patio process of amalgamating silver is
still generally used. This first came into use in
1557, being discovered by Bartolome de Medina,
a miner. The ore is first crushed into a powder
by an immense rolling stone that is revolved by
teams of mules. This powder is then carried into
a patio, or paved court, by a stream of water
until the mass is about two feet deep. Quicksilver,
salt and blue vitriol are then thrown
into it and several teams of mules are driven
around and around until the mass is thoroughly
mixed, which requires several weeks. This is
then thrown into troughs of water, where the
amalgam of silver and quicksilver will sink to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the bottom. By a process of distillation the silver
is then separated from the quicksilver.
Within five years after the discovery of this
process Zacatecas alone had thirty-five of these
reduction works in operation. It is claimed that
not over ten per cent. is lost by this simple
method. The poor mules eventually become
horrible looking sights from the action of the
vitriol on their legs. This patio mud has been
used in the construction of the huts of the peons.
A company was formed to tear down a whole
row of these huts in Guanajuato just to extract
the little metal that was left in them. The crown
retained a monopoly on the quicksilver, and
realized great profits upon this necessary metal
in treating the silver ore.</p>

<p>The first bonanza mines were discovered at
Zacatecas in 1546 by Juan de Tolosa. So rich
were they and so great was the influx of miners,
that the place was made a city forty years later.
For two hundred and fifty years fabulous sums
of silver were taken from the hills surrounding
this quaint city. Some of the richest mines of
the country have been located near Pachuca.
More than three hundred silver mines are found
there and in the near-by districts of Regla and
Real del Monte. One mine, The Trinidad, is
said to have yielded $50,000,000 in ten years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
There was very little stock speculation with the
mines in the early days. There was at least one
exception where an English company bought an
old producing mine and the $500 shares rose to
$80,000 but in the end the mine proved to be a
failure. Catorce is also a rich mining town, and
the mines have produced many millions of silver
ore. The State of Oaxaca is likewise rich in gold
and silver bearing quartz. None of the great
bonanzas were found there, but a steady stream
of gold and silver has been produced by the
Oaxaca mines. I heard an interesting story of
a young prospector who had spent several years
and all his money in the search for wealth near
Ejutla in that state. Having only a few dollars
left he invested his all in dynamite and placed
it in the lode with a prayer for luck. The blast
revealed a rich “lead” which he sold for $600,000
a few days later.</p>

<p>The richest mineralized section in the whole
republic is probably that in and around Guanajuato,
the “hill of the frogs.” This district
was discovered by two mule drivers in 1548 who
were on their way from Zacatecas to the City
of Mexico, and from that date until the present
time a billion and a half dollars’ worth of silver
has been produced. A hundred years ago Guanajuato
was one of the largest cities and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
admitted by all travellers to be one of the most
picturesque cities in the New World. Its
wealthy mine owners lived like princes and
spent their money like drunken sailors. Fortunes
were made and lost. About a hundred
years ago two mines there were producing four
million ounces of silver annually. These mines
were worked by the Aztecs long before the
Spaniards came. This is called the La Luz
district.</p>

<p>To-day Guanajuato is a much smaller city
than it was a half century ago because of the
decrease in mining activity. The Theatre
Juarez is a beautiful building and was built
and is owned by the state, which seems strange
to an American. The state or municipal ownership
of theatres in Spanish-American countries
is quite common. The Republic of Guatemala
takes more pride in its national theatre, the
Teatre Colon (Columbus), than in any other
public building. A curious sight in this city of
Guanajuato is the panteon, or crypt, where bodies
are buried for five years. If burial fees are
not paid again at the end of that time, the bones
are thrown in a heap. However, many of the
bodies are found mummified and these are
placed against the wall making a horrible, gruesome
sight,—one that will not be soon forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
by the traveller. It is like the crypt
underneath the Capuchin Church in Rome.</p>

<p>The Spanish conquerors mentioned nothing of
silver among the Aztecs, but all their ornaments
were of gold. The value of the presents
of gold ornaments given to Cortez by Montezuma
is estimated by Prescott at more than
$7,000,000. The source of this great gold supply
has never been discovered, for, although gold in
small quantities is found in many places intermingled
with silver, yet the amount mined was
very small in comparison with the value of the
silver. In more recent years owing to improved
methods of separating the precious metals from
the quartz, the proportion of gold produced has
been increasing. From 1810 to 1884 mining
reached a very low ebb because of the unstable
form of government and constant revolutionary
movements. The crude methods formerly in use
became unprofitable, and foreign capitalists
were afraid to invest money for fear that a
change in the government might occur over
night and wipe out everything. The old mines
had been worked to such a depth that they
were flooded and could not be kept in workable
condition by the bucket brigade. The disturbed
political conditions had developed large and
bold bands of robbers; and as all traffic had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
be carried over lonely mountain trails, mining
became very insecure and consequently unprofitable.</p>

<p>Since the extension of the railway systems
and the establishment of a stable government,
mining is again attracting a great deal of attention.
The government encourages foreign investments
in the mines. Many of the old bonanzas
have been taken over by new companies with
both good and bad results for the investors.
The introduction of modern machinery has so
reduced the cost of mining that lower grade ores
can be profitably worked. Even the dumps that
have been accumulating for centuries are being
worked over at a fair profit. Smelters and mills
for the cyanide process are springing up in all
of the mining regions. Modern pumps are taking
the place of the mule and windlass in keeping
the mines free from water. The fame of
the old bonanzas has no doubt aided in fleecing
the gullible through fake companies organized
by unscrupulous and even criminal promoters.
American miners and prospectors are met with
all over Mexico in the mining districts. It is
safe to say that the majority of them have
either met with disappointment or are living
in hope of a “strike.” These conditions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the same in every mining district the world
over.</p>

<p>The mining laws are simple and practical.
Boards are established in every mining community
who look after the mining interests.
Any one discovering a claim can “denounce”
it before this board and he is protected. Foreigners
have the same rights as citizens in
“denouncing” a claim. A mining claim is
called a “<i>pertenencia</i>” and is one hundred
metres square thus consisting of ten thousand
square metres. The surface ground must be
settled for with the owner. A tax of ten dollars
must be paid annually to protect the claim
from forfeiture. More than twelve thousand
claims are now on record as shown by government
statistics. The government only claims
a one-twenty-fifth instead of the royal one-fifth
exacted by Spain.</p>

<p>The number of men employed in the mines
at the present time is about two hundred thousand.
Wages are low and average about fifty
cents for common labour and one dollar for
native miners in Mexican money. However,
in recent years wages at the mines have had
a tendency to rise. Mexico’s annual production
of silver amounts to from $30,000,000 to
$35,000,000 in gold value and gives it first place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
As the price of silver is advancing, the production
will no doubt be further stimulated.
It now occupies fifth place in the production of
gold, being exceeded only by the Transvaal,
Australia, United States and Russia. The production
of Mexico in 1906 reached a value of
$15,000,000.</p>

<p>Many other minerals are found in Mexico.
Perhaps the most valuable, next after gold and
silver, is copper of which there are a number
of rich deposits. In 1906, one hundred and
thirty-five million pounds of copper were
mined. When this is compared with a production
of nine hundred and fifteen million pounds
in the United States for the same period it is
not a bad showing for Mexico. Iron is not generally
distributed but there is a mountain of
nearly ninety per cent. pure iron ore at Durango.
Tradition says that the Indians first
led the Spaniards to Durango by tales of a
mountain of gold where the yellow metal
sparkled on the surface. When they arrived
at this mountain, now called Cerro del Mercado,
they pointed to the outcroppings of pyrites
which the ignorant natives thought—or
pretended to think—were of the same metal
that these strange white men had come across
the unknown seas in search of. A little coal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
has been found but not in quantities sufficient
for local consumption, so that considerable coal
and coke are imported each year from England
and the United States. Lead is found in large
quantities, and most of the graphite used in the
United States is imported from Mexico. The
greatest development in recent years has been
in the production of petroleum. Some of the
most remarkable flowing wells in the world have
been struck near Tampico. Great rivalry has
resulted between the English and American
interests, and the Mexicans have profited by
it. Another profitable field has been found on
the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The total production
for the year 1910 exceeded four million
barrels. Several of the railways have already
adopted this fuel.</p>

<p>Wonderful progress is being made in developing
the mineral resources of this country,
and it is possible that greater discoveries will
yet be made. The wealth of Mexico to-day is
not being squandered after the manner of
many of the bonanza kings; but it is being
spent along legitimate lines, and is one of the
greatest aids in building up a strong republic
and developing a nation of intelligent and
liberty-loving citizens.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">RAILWAYS AND THEIR INFLUENCE</span></h2>

<p>A work upon Mexico would be incomplete
without a description of the railways and the
present progressive railway movement. Nothing
has contributed in such a degree to the
great progress that has been made in the last
quarter of a century in Mexico, as the rapidly
increasing railway lines. This is true not only
of the influence these advance agents of progressiveness
have had upon commerce, but they
have enlarged the intercourse with other nations,
especially with the United States.
Through this means the dormant energies and
ambitions of the Mexican people have been
awakened, and a new era has dawned in our
Latin neighbour.</p>

<p>The centres of population in Mexico have
always been situated in the great central plateaus
in the interior. Only a very small proportion
of the population live on, or near the
coast. Communication with the ports was over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
long, narrow and rough trails. The transportation
of commerce was slow and expensive,
and required great droves of slow-moving pack
mules and patient burros, and whole armies of
cargadors. Furthermore, the very isolation of
the people and difficulty of communication kept
them aloof from modern progress, and left
them content with things as they were, with no
ambition for anything more advanced or better
than had been enjoyed by their forefathers.
It also prevented the development of a real,
national spirit, because one community was, in
a true sense, not familiar with the neighbouring
cities, and took a special pride in its local
interests rather than in the idea of a homogeneous,
strongly-centred whole.</p>

<p>So jealous were those employed in the business
of transportation in the old crude way,
that, in order to placate them, some of the earlier
roads were obliged to commence construction
at the point furthermost from the port,
in order to give employment to these people
in transporting the material from the port to
the place of beginning. Those who are familiar
with the great development of the west, since
the construction of our own trans-continental
lines, will better appreciate the change that railroad
construction has wrought in Mexico.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
There is this difference, however, that the people
were in Mexico before the railroads were
built, and, instead of a newly-developed country
it is a rejuvenated old country.</p>

<p>Prior to the beginning of the railway movement,
Mexico was noted chiefly for its minerals.
Now, although only a small portion of the
mineral wealth has been dug out of the earth,
mining has become of secondary importance.
The increase in commerce and manufacturing,
and the stimulus to agriculture brought about
by these avenues of communication, have
swelled the general wealth of the country far
more than the millions of white metal extracted
from old mother earth each year. Manufacturing
plants have sprung up on every hand, and
the products of the mills are increasing in
volume and variety each year. Mexico could,
probably, after a fashion, supply all the wants
of her people without any imports from the
outside world. The factories include almost
every line of trade from the making of articles
to adorn the outward man to the solid and
liquid goods which cheer and sustain the inward
man.</p>

<p>The railroads have tended to enlarge the
wants of the people by throwing them into contact
with other civilizations and have raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the general standard of wages so that the people
have more money to expend for material
needs and luxuries. The abolishment of the
<i>alcabales</i>, or local customs, was the logical result
of the development of railways and was
almost revolutionary. From the time of the
Spanish conquest each city had collected a local
tariff on all goods brought into the town for
sale, and had raised a great part of its revenues
in this way. Changes come slow in this country,
but are nevertheless sure. It may be that
at some time in the future the brown back of the
burden-bearing cargador will be relieved of its
load. It is a question, however, whether this
change would be welcomed by the dusky descendants
of Montezuma.</p>

<p>The encouragement given to railroad construction
has been done with a lavish but well-directed
hand. It is estimated that more than
one hundred and fifty million dollars have been
spent by the Mexican government in subsidizing
railroads and in developing harbours, and the
end is not in sight yet. Perhaps the motive
has not been altogether unselfish for no one influence
has assisted so much in centralizing the
power in the hands of the Diaz government or
been such a potent force in tranquillizing a
naturally turbulent people, as the railways and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the telegraph lines which always accompany
them. Instant notice would be sent of any
embryonic revolutionary movement and troops
could be hurried to the affected district at once.
There were at the close of 1906, according to
government report, twenty-one thousand six
hundred and eleven kilometers of railway track
in Mexico, or about thirteen thousand five hundred
miles, and this is increasing at the rate
of several hundred miles each year. The subsidies
on the principal lines have averaged
from $10,000 to $15,000 per English mile, with
the provision in most instances that after a
certain period (generally ninety-nine years)
the roads shall revert to the government at a
certain fixed valuation. Construction is either
of such a difficult character, or over such long
stretches of semi-desert territory with poor and
scattered population, that most of these roads
would never have been built except for government
assistance.</p>

<p>After the manner of the Romans and with
equal truthfulness, the Mexicans say that all
roads lead to the City of Mexico. This saying
is almost literally true. The Valley of Mexico
is traversed from every direction with the <i>ferro
carriles</i>, or roads of iron, converging toward
the capital. It now has direct communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
by rail with almost every part of the republic
except Yucatan and the Pacific slope, and can
reach this coast at one point by a roundabout
way to Salina Cruz.</p>

<p>The back-bone of the extensive railway system
is formed by the two great trunk lines
which reach out to the north from the City of
Mexico, gradually diverging until at the places
where they cross the muddy Rio Grande they
are several hundred miles apart. These railways
traverse the broad central plateau of
which Humboldt, the great traveller, wrote, “so
regular is the great plateau and so gentle are
the slopes where depressions occur, that the
journey from Mexico to Santa Fe, New Mexico,
might be made in a four-wheeled vehicle.”
There are hundreds of miles where construction
work was exceedingly easy, as it consisted
simply of shovelling up a slightly raised bed
and laying the ties and rail. Rough mountain
construction in other places, and especially in
entering the Valley of Mexico, required the
work of the very best engineers. By whichever
route the traveller enters Mexico it would be
well if he could sleep over the first two hundred
miles while the train is passing over the semi-desert
plains of Northern Mexico where the
dust filters through the car windows in clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The government of Mexico has entered the
railway field for economic reasons. It is simply
another indication of the intention on the part
of President Diaz to control the railway situation
in behalf of the people by preventing excessive
rates through the pooling of interests.
The spectre of railway consolidation similar to
the merging of the great systems in the United
States influenced the officials more than anything
else, and the government did not want the
railway situation in Mexico controlled by any
of the large American companies. The project
was begun only a few years ago by actual purchase
in the open market of a controlling interest
in the National railroad. This purchase
was made by a select firm of New York brokers,
and the real buyer was not revealed until sufficient
stock had been secured to insure control
of the properties. These lines are now known
as the National Lines of Mexico and have a
mileage of about eight thousand miles. They
will be held by a corporation with a capital of
$250,000,000, organized under the laws of
Mexico, the control of which will be vested in
the Mexican government, although there will be
a minority board in New York. They include
one hundred and sixty miles of track in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
United States from Laredo to Corpus Christi,
Texas.</p>

<p>The main line of the system is the former
National Railroad extending from Laredo to the
capital, a distance of eight hundred and thirty-nine
miles, several hundred miles shorter than
the Central. It passes through the important
cities of Monterey, Saltillo, San Luis Potosi and
Celaya. Originally constructed as a narrow
gauge line, it has been changed to standard
width throughout its entire length. The Mexican
International Railroad, which enters Mexico at
Eagle Pass and runs through Torreon to Durango
with a branch to Monterey, has been
added. The Interoceanic Railway, whose main
line connects the capital with Vera Cruz, passing
through Puebla, the third largest city in
Mexico, is also now a part of this system. At
the present time this line is narrow gauge, but
preparations are now being made to widen it to
standard gauge. Quite recently the government
purchased the Hidalgo Railroad, which extends
from the City of Mexico to Pachuca, State of
Hidalgo. It is the intention of the government
to extend this line immediately to Tampico, thus
making a short and direct route to this port.</p>

<p>In December, 1906, the government announced
the purchase of the Mexican Central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Railway, its only large competitor, and this road
will be added to the system known as the National
Lines. The reasons for this purchase
were stated by Minister of Finance Limantour
to be “the aggressive attitude assumed by certain
great railway systems in the United
States.” It was feared that the great railways
of the United States would step in and absorb
this important line, and saddle upon the people
the trust evil. The Mexican Central is the
largest railway system within the republic and
owns more than three thousand five hundred
miles of track. The main line extends from El
Paso, Texas, to the capital in a southeasterly
direction a distance of one thousand two hundred
and twenty-four miles. This was the first
road constructed to the United States border
and received the largest subsidy of any line,
amounting to $15,200 per mile. Construction
work was begun in 1880 at both terminal points
and rushed to completion so that through trains
were running less than four years later. This
made an average of nearly one mile for each
working day. It traverses sections rich in agriculture
and mineral resources and passes
through many of the important cities. Among
these are Chihuahua, Torreon, Zacatecas, Aguas
Calientes, Leon, Irapuato, Celaya and Querétero.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
It reaches a population of several millions
on the table lands.</p>

<p>Two important branches of the main line run
to the gulf port of Tampico, which is second
only in importance to Vera Cruz. One of these
lines branches off at Aguas Calientes passing
through San Luis Potosi, and the other at
Torreon, passing through Monterey. At Irapuato
a branch line runs west to Guadalajara,
the second largest city in Mexico, and is being
extended through to Manzanillo, a good harbour
on the Pacific coast. It is expected that this
road will be completed January, 1908, and will
give the capital what has long been needed—a
direct route to the Pacific. The difficulty and
great cost of construction in reaching this coast
has delayed the various projected lines, for the
drop from the high plateaus to the sea level is
very abrupt. It is estimated that the last hundred
miles of this extension will cost $5,000,000
in gold. Another branch of this system extends
south from the capital through ancient Cuernevaca
to the Balsas River, with an ultimate destination
of Acapulco, the finest harbour on the
Pacific Coast of either North or South America.
There are also numerous smaller and less important
feeders.</p>

<p>The Mexican Railway which connects the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
port of Vera Cruz with the City of Mexico is the
oldest railroad in the republic. It was first incorporated
under the empire in 1864 as the Imperial
Mexican Railway and exceedingly favourable
concessions were granted. Owing to the
political disturbances it was not completed until
1873. It was built with English capital and cost
a fabulous sum. The monopoly which it held for
years enabled it to pay big returns to its owners
for a long period and even now its earnings
compare favourably with our own western lines.
This road is noted as one of the most picturesque
railways in the world, for in a few
hours one is transported from the high plateaus
to the sea level.</p>

<p class="caption">ALONG THE MEXICAN SOUTHERN RAILWAY</p>
</div>

<p>The Mexican Southern Railway is another
English road extending from Puebla south to
Oaxaca, which was opened for traffic in 1893,
a distance of 227 miles. This road received a
bonus of about $10,000,000 in government
bonds, and well it needed such an inducement,
for the traveller wonders in passing over the
line where the profit can come from, as there
are only a very few places of any size between
the two terminal points. It opens up a rich
agricultural and mineral section in the Valley
of Oaxaca, and will probably develop into a
profitable property in the future. As the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
runs through narrow ravines a great part of the
way, following streams, the traveller does not
see the best part of the country traversed.</p>

<p>The Southern Pacific has a branch which
runs from Benson, Arizona, to Guaymas, the
chief port on the Gulf of California, passing
through Hermosillo, the capital of the State of
Sonora, the home of the Yaqui Indians. It
passes through an intensely interesting country,
possessing a wealth of scenery and natural resources.
This line is being extended farther
south, with an ultimate destination of Guadalajara
or possibly the capital city.</p>

<p>Another important link in the system of railroads
in Mexico, and one which is practically
owned by the government is the Vera Cruz and
Pacific Railway. This road extends from Vera
Cruz to Santa Lucrecia, a station on the Tehuantepec
National Railway which is described in
another chapter. A branch line also extends
to Cordoba, there connecting with the Mexican
Railway, and forms what is at present the only
all-rail route from the capital to a Pacific port.
This road runs through the heart of the
tropics and alternately passes over prairie and
through tropical jungle.</p>

<p>A trip over this road is a revelation to the
traveller who has never visited a tropical land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
No one except those who assisted in the work
fully appreciates the enormous difficulties that
had to be overcome. I doubt if even mountains
present more perplexing problems in railroad
construction than these level prairies and
swamps, where there is no solid rock or gravel
and the country is deluged with an annual rainfall
of from twelve to sixteen feet. The surface
is a soft clay unfit for roadbed or ballast. After
heavy rains the ties and often the rails would
sink into it until completely covered. For a
few years the road was practically abandoned
for several weeks during the heaviest rainfall.
The track would sometimes slip sideways, or
in a cut the banks would slide in and cover it.
In the two hundred and forty-two miles of the
main line, the road crosses six large rivers,
whose size is due to the amount of rainfall
rather than the extent of territory drained.
These rivers and many smaller streams require
an average of more than one bridge for each
mile of track. The uncertainty and inefficiency
of native help and difficulty of getting skilled
American labour to go there because of the fear
of tropical fevers, rendered the work of the
contractor no easy task. Even an American
workman could not accomplish more than about
half as much as in a colder climate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>I made this trip when it required twenty-six
hours to cover the two hundred miles from Vera
Cruz to Santa Lucrecia. No one asked the
engineer to go faster, and we considered ourselves
in luck not to run off the rails, which in
many places resembled the track made by a
wobbly wheel after we had passed over it. It
has now been placed in better condition, and the
run is made in much quicker time. No one
must expect quick time on Mexican railroads,
for twenty-five miles an hour is fast travelling
and the average is nearer fifteen miles. The
section traversed by this road must inevitably
be the richest part of Mexico in the near future,
now that it has an outlet. It passes through the
region best adapted for tropical plantations
where the soil is inexhaustible.</p>

<p>One of the dreams of the late James G. Blaine
was a Pan-American railroad or all-rail route
from the United States to the southernmost republics
of South America. President Arthur
appointed a commission in 1884 which was sent
to the republics of Central and South America
along the proposed route. At the first Pan-American
conference held in Washington, this
projected railway was discussed at considerable
length. All the representatives were in favour
of it and a survey was decided upon. Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
parties of surveyors were set to work at different
points along the proposed route, and a
complete survey was made from Oaxaca,
Mexico, to the northernmost point reached by
the railways of the Argentine Republic. The
proposition excited a great deal of interest and
discussion at the time, but little has been heard
of it in recent years. There is one man in
Mexico, however, who has not lost sight of the
great project, and that man is J. M. Neeland.
He organized a company to build the Pan-American
Railroad from San Geronimo, a station on
the Tehuantepec National Railroad to the
boundary of Guatemala, a distance of about
three hundred miles. The Mexican government
promised a subsidy of $10,000 gold, per mile.
He has followed the base of the mountain range
in order to lessen the expense of construction,
and render it easy to connect with the ports
by means of branch lines. It follows as nearly
as possible an old military road constructed by
the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Quietly and unostentatiously this line has
been pushed forward until it has been completed
to Pijijiapam, only one hundred and twenty-six
miles from the Guatemala boundary, and a contract
has been let for its completion by the close
of the year 1907. The importance of this line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
to Mexico can hardly be overestimated, for it
connects the seat of government by an all-rail
line with the most remote corner of the republic.
It also opens up the rich coffee lands in the
State of Chiapas, the best coffee territory in
Mexico. The ports along this coast are all open
roadsteads without piers, and freight is carried
to and from the steamers in lighters. At one
time a steamer on which I was a passenger lay
at San Benito, the most southerly Pacific port
of Mexico and on the line of this railway, three
days in order to load a few thousand bags of
coffee. This part of the country has been so
isolated heretofore that it has never been developed
to any extent. The completion of this
Pan-American railroad will greatly increase
the influence of Mexico in the little Republic of
Guatemala, and will have a tendency to render
that country less turbulent. The promoters aim
to continue this road through all the republics
of Central America, clear to the Isthmus of
Panama. They have already secured a concession
with the promise of a good subsidy from
Guatemala, and will utilize a portion of a railroad
now in operation in that country. A remarkable
fact in connection with this road is
that it is already meeting its operating expenses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and fixed charges, which is an unusual showing
for a newly-built Mexican railroad.</p>

<p>The government is now endeavouring to have
a railroad constructed from some point on the
Pan-American Railroad to connect with the railways
of Yucatan. This road and the other lines
already under construction will connect all parts
of the republic with the bands of steel, with the
single exception of Lower California. It will
not be many years before this great plan of a
great president will be a reality. Step by step
progress has been made but the improvement
has been permanent. In some places the innovation
was not welcomed at first, because of
extreme conservatism. Now everyone reaps
some benefit from it. Before the days of railroads
each community lived by itself, and the
poor natives were at the mercy of the rich
plantation owners in the dry years which sometimes
occurred. Now, transportation is cheap
and quick, and everyone can have food at a
reasonable cost. The paternal character of the
government in this respect was shown a few
years ago, when the corn crop was a partial
failure and a “corner” was attempted by the
dealers. The government immediately removed
the tariff, imported great quantities of grain,
and sold it to the people at cost. This could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
have been done except for the facilities afforded
by the railway lines. The traffic does
not seem large, and there is only one train per
day each way on most of the lines, and on the
branches this is frequently a mixed passenger
and freight train. The tonnage is increasing
each year as the wants of the people increase,
and money to purchase things heretofore regarded
as luxuries becomes more abundant.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Note to Revised Edition.</span> In 1911 the railway mileage of
Mexico exceeded 15,000 miles. The Pan-American Railroad
is now completed to Mariscal, on the Guatemala border. Work
on the connecting link with the lines of that republic, only
about thirty miles, is progressing, and it is estimated that within
a year it will be possible to travel by rail from New York to
Guatemala City. The Pan-American and the Vera Cruz and
Pacific Railroads are now a part of the National Lines. The
name of the latter has been changed to the Vera Cruz and
Isthmus Railroad. The Manzanillo branch was completed
almost on time. The extension of the Southern Pacific as far
as the city of Tepic, and the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient
Railway are described in a succeeding chapter.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">RELIGIOUS FORCES</span></h2>

<p>The Aztecs, who originally believed in one
supreme invisible creator, Taotl, adopted the
gods of conquered races, like the Romans of
old, and became polytheists. The Toltecs, one
of the vanquished people, were nature worshippers,
and made offerings of fruits and
flowers to their deities. After their defeat, the
peaceful gods of the Toltecs, who took pleasure
in the offerings of the fruits of the soil, soon
took a place by the side of the terrible god of
war of the Aztecs, Huitzilopoxtli, and shared
with him the offerings of human sacrifices.
This repulsive deity is portrayed as a hideous
idol with broad face, wide mouth and terrible
eyes, but was covered with jewels of gold and
pearls and girt with golden serpents. At the
altars hung censers of incense and braziers
filled with the hearts of the victims offered in
sacrifice. It is said that this god was ministered
to by more than five thousand priests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Spanish conquerors came, the
policy of Cortez left the Mexicans no alternative
but the adoption of the Christian religion.
“Conversion” and “Baptism” became interchangeable
terms and the baptized pagan
was immediately considered a good Christian
even though the conversion only followed the
judicious use of the fire and rack. One of the
priests boasted that his “ordinary day’s work
was from ten to twenty thousand souls.”
Within a few years after the conquest baptism
had been administered to more than four million
Indians. Dreams of avarice swayed the
minds of the conquering legions, for it was believed
that from the unknown, western world
was to come the gold that was to make every
man a Crœsus. But first these ungodly people
must be converted to Romanism. As the unlettered
Indians could not understand the real
spirit and meaning of this new religion, visible
symbols and pictures were substituted for the
former idols. Humboldt, the traveller so often
quoted because of his careful research, says:
“The introduction of the Romish religion had
no other effect upon the Mexicans than to substitute
new ceremonies and symbols for the
rites of a sanguinary worship. Dogma has not
succeeded dogma, but only ceremony to ceremony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
I have seen them marked and adorned
with tinkling bells, perform savage dances
around the altar while a monk of St. Francis
elevated the Host.” It soon became a religious
duty for the Spaniard returning from Europe
to bring paintings and statues of saints to
adorn the newly-erected churches, and holy
relics of the saints to place therein. In this
way these cruel invaders no doubt sought to
satisfy their consciences for their outrages
upon a mild and unresisting people. It is little
wonder that the Indians could not fully appreciate
the humanity of the lowly Nazarene
when represented by such ferocious invaders.</p>

<p>A few of the Aztec gods blossomed out as
Christian saints soon after the Conquest,
through the ingenious schemes of the early
priests who adopted this method to make the
new religion accepted. They brought with them
into the Roman Church the particular characteristics
and powers which they were credited
with as gods. As for example, the goddess of
the rains who was much worshipped in the
regions of little rain can be recognized in Our
Lady of the Mists, or Our Lady of the Rains
of the Mexican church. These saints are appealed
to for the much-needed rain and are believed
to have the same power to bring it which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
they, as Aztec or Toltec gods, were supposed to
have had. In many places there are shrines
erected to these saints of the Church who are
supposed to have power over the rain. It has
been proven that, in most instances, in Aztec
times, a temple existed on the same spot dedicated
to the goddess of the rains or mists, as
the case might be.</p>

<p>These schemes of miraculous appearances
upon scenes already sacred made the transition
from the native ceremonies to the ritual of the
Catholic Church easy to a people who were accustomed
to outward show and symbolism. The
striking ceremonies of the Catholic Church, as
practised in Mexico, and its impressive services
in an unknown tongue, seemed in harmony
with the rites of the Aztecs, and it was not hard
for Cortez to force his religion upon the simple
and superstitious mind of the poor, conquered
Indian, who was more interested in form than
sentiment. The religion of the Roman Church
in Mexico is not free from pagan features even
to this day. As one writer expresses it
“paganism was baptized, Christianity paganized.”
Outward display means more than
spirituality and piety with the ignorant who
constitute a very large proportion of the population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>One can still recognize in the rites of the
Catholic Church, as practised to-day in Mexico,
a tinge of the Aztec worship. A noted French
Catholic prelate, Abbe Domenech, in 1867
wrote of that church as follows: “Mexican
faith is a dead faith. The abuse of external
ceremonies, the facility of reconciling the devil
with God, the absence of internal exercise of
piety, have killed the faith in Mexico. The idolatrous
character of Mexican Catholicism is a
fact well known to all travellers. The worship
of saints and madonnas so absorbs the devotion
of the people that little time is left to think
about God. The Indians go to hear mass with
their poultry and vegetables, which they are
carrying to market. The gobble of the turkeys,
the crowing of the cocks, the mewing of the cats,
the chirping of the birds in their nests in the
ceiling, and the flea-bites rendered meditation
impossible to me, unaccustomed to live in such
a menagerie.”</p>

<p class="caption">WAYSIDE SHRINE WITH AN OFFERING OF FLOWERS</p>
</div>

<p>In remote caves of mountain regions it is
claimed, and, I believe, truthfully, that the
ancient deities are still worshipped. It is no
infrequent occurrence to see a bouquet of flowers
before the image of the virgin in the churches
or wayside shrines. Sometimes even offerings
of wheat or fruits are found, the gift of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
poor peon in whose mind the conception of the
Saviour and his mission on earth is very vague.
Several writers assert that they have personally
seen Indians on their way to the mountains to
sacrifice lambs, chickens and flowers to their
gods, thus proving that the grosser forms of
paganism have not been stamped out entirely.
The priests, of course, do not approve of this,
and try in every way to stop these practices,
but without success.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church used to be all-powerful
in Mexico. It held the wealth and the learning,
and the priests preyed upon the people as well
as prayed for them. They were taxed to the
utmost, and “Pay or pray” was the motto affixed
to the cross by the priests. Rich men gave
freely of their substance. Poor peons—and
they are vastly in the majority—went clothed
in rags that the Church might be benefited. The
favourite method was by the sale of indulgences.
General Thompson, United States Minister to
Mexico in 1845, wrote as follows: “As a means
of raising money, I would not give the single
institution of the Catholic religion (in Mexico)
of masses and indulgences for the benefit of the
souls of the dead for the power of taxation
possessed by any government. I remember that
my washerwoman once asked me to lend her two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
dollars. I asked her what she wanted with it.
She told me that there was a particular mass to
be said on that day which relieved the souls in
purgatory from ten thousand years’ torture
and that she wished to secure the benefit for her
mother.” It is like the harangue that so
aroused Martin Luther: “The very moment the
money clicks on the bottom of this chest the
soul escapes from purgatory and flies to
Heaven! Bring your money, bring money,
bring money!”</p>

<p>Shrines and chapels were so numerous that
the true believer passed through the streets
with head uncovered and hat in hand, for fear
that he might pass one unobserved and not remove
his head covering as piety demanded.
During the latter years of Spanish rule in
Mexico, the Church became so enormously rich
that it was reported to have in its possession
one-third of all the wealth in Mexico. In addition
to the power the Church naturally held, this
immense wealth gave its leaders great prestige
in governmental affairs, for wealth everywhere
commands power and respect among those in
authority. At one time the clergy held property
to the value of about $180,000,000, yielding an
annual income of $12,000,000, according to reliable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
authorities. Some have estimated the wealth
at more than $600,000,000.</p>

<p>It had secured control not only of the wealth,
but also much of the best agricultural land
within the republic, owning eight hundred
<i>haciendas</i> and more than twenty-two thousand
city lots. All this was tied up and became useless
and non-productive. The Church used its
great influence to oppose all progress. The opposition
finally broke forth, and the immense
wealth of convents, shrines and monasteries
was poured forth with lavish hand in what the
Church considered a holy war against heretical
ideas and persons. Reformers set envious eyes
upon this property, and numerous attempts
were made to dispossess the Church of it. An
edict aimed at the power of the Church was
issued by Commonfort in 1857, but the Indian
reformer and president, Juarez, was the first to
actually accomplish the separation of church
and state several years later. The establishment
of the empire with Maximilian as
Emperor was simply a reaction, and an attempt
to establish a government in which the interests
of the Church would again be paramount. It
is not much wonder that the native population
yielded so readily to the overthrow of the
priestly power. In accomplishing the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
overthrow of church and state, Mexico only
did what Italy did a few years later, and what
France is endeavouring to do at the present
time. Even in Spain, the handwriting on the
walls seems to point to the same ultimate result.
And yet it is strange to see a nation so rigidly
and even unmercifully regulating a church to
which ninety-five per cent. of the people belong.</p>

<p>The reactionary movement on the part of the
Church under the guise of French intervention
failed. The reform anti-clerical movement prevailed
once more, even though opposed by the
enormous wealth of the Church. The greater
portion of the property once owned by the
Church has been lost. The country abounds in
ruined churches and convents. The law went so
far as to prohibit the Church from holding the
title to property, and if it wished to own property,
it must be in the names of individuals.
Priests were forbidden, under penalty of fine
and imprisonment, to appear in the streets in
their clerical dress. Religious processions outside
the walls of the church, or churchyard, were
prohibited. Civil ceremonies were made obligatory
to render a marriage valid. Sisters of
Charity and the Jesuits were sent out of the
country, and even the ringing of bells was regulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
by law. It has now lost not only its property
but its prestige as well.</p>

<p>The property was confiscated, or “denounced,”
and sold for beggarly sums in
numerous instances. Many hotels are now
located in former churches or convents, and
schools and barracks innumerable occupy former
homes of nuns. Even the famous prison of
Belem in the City of Mexico, where more than
three thousand offenders (most of them justly
no doubt) have been incarcerated at times, was
the old convent of that name; and the military
prison, Santiago de Tlalteloco, was one of the
oldest churches in Mexico, having been founded
by the first viceroy. Protestant services are
held in a number of places that were former
Catholic churches, the buildings having been
purchased by these organizations, or the use of
them granted by the authorities. The rich silver
plate and the altar rails were looted from
the sacred edifices, or were sold for small sums
by the officers.</p>

<p>For many years Mexico has thus gone along
the line of reform. The ambition of the Church
has been held in check but not killed. They are
regaining some of their former power, and recovering
much of their former property, so it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
claimed by good authority.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The average Mexican
is superstitious. He is boastful and bold in
times of peace, but craven when the time of
trial comes. Consequently, when sick and about
to die, he will send for the priest, no matter
how he may have fought the Church when in
health. The priests, or some of them at least,
claiming that the Catholic Church, as the chosen
of the Lord, has a lien on all earthly goods, refuse
to administer the sacrament without some
restitution. If the dying man owns a confiscated
church property, he must restore its
value before he can get a clear title to a home
in Heaven. With the persistence characteristic
of the Mexican Catholic priests, they are
ferreting out their former property and again
accumulating wealth for their beloved Church.
Their fees are utterly out of proportion to the
earning capacity of the people. Marriage costs
$14.00, baptism $2.25 and plain mass $6.00.
Many of the poor peons are obliged to forego
the services of the Church because of these
high charges, for all services must be paid in
advance.</p>

<p>They are also openly disregarding the established
laws in some of the restrictions imposed.
I travelled for two days on the railroad with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Bishop of Tehuantepec who wore his purple
robes of office all the time. At nearly every
station priests met him, and he was given a
continuous ovation. A few months ago, according
to a Mexican periodical, a well known
priest, in defiance of the law which prohibits
public religious processions, authorized such a
procession, and blessed at the altar those who
arrived with it. In many of the more remote
districts the law requiring marriage ceremonies
to be made by civil authorities is completely
disregarded. The priests tell the people that
the religious ceremony is all that is necessary.
Although the Church upholds such marriages,
in law they are absolutely null and void, and it
is a deceit upon the contracting parties. Some
priests go so far as to tell their people that the
civil marriage is positively impious. And yet
nothing is done to punish the above violations
of the established laws. The government probably
does not consider that these infractions of
the strict letter of the law have reached a
serious phase.</p>

<p>If the Roman Church of Mexico to-day, with
its wealth confiscated, its public voice muzzled,
its political powers annulled, has still power
so that it can openly violate some of the fundamental
laws of the country, we can have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
faint idea of its power when it ruled the country
with an iron hand. Those who see trouble
ahead because of the avariciousness of some of
the clergy, are fond of quoting the old Spanish
proverb “The devil lurks behind the cross.”
Nevertheless, I believe that the clergy in Mexico
to-day are superior to those who served prior
to the change in status. Many of them are noble
men striving to uplift the people and aid the
government in its campaign for the enlightenment
of the masses. The strife has purified
them and they think less of the perquisites than
the duties of their office. The well meaning
priest no doubt suffers for the sins of his predecessors
as well as those of his contemporaries
who are blinded by the past glory of the Church.
The Church as an institution is probably to some
extent the victim of the ignorance and fanatical
zeal of its early founders in Mexico. The
Church will thrive far more when placed on the
same footing as all churches are in the United
States, and people and priest accept that condition.
As one prominent American priest has
recently said in commenting on the struggle in
France: “Everywhere that church and state
are united, the church is in bondage. Nowhere
is the church so free and untrammelled, or so
progressive, as in the United States.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>The churches in all the cities are numerous
and their capacity far greater than the number
of those attending. Puebla, the City of the
Angels, so called because of the many miraculous
visits of the angels who even, on their first
visit, measured off the city and fixed the site of
some churches, is called the city of churches as
it has the greatest number in proportion to the
population of any city in the republic, many of
them being erected in honour of the various
angelic visitations. The City of Mexico contains
the largest and most pretentious church
building in the new world—the cathedral.
It is also one of the largest church edifices
in the world. This grand cathedral begun
in 1573 was ready for service about three-quarters
of a century later but the towers
were not completed until 1791. It is four hundred
and twenty-six feet long and almost two
hundred feet wide with walls of great thickness,
and reaches a height of one hundred and
seventy-five feet in the dome. The towers are a
little more than two hundred feet high. Then
adjoining this building is another church, the
Sagrario Metropolitano, which, to all appearances,
is a part of the main structure, although
of an entirely different and less beautiful style
of architecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>Within these two edifices were concentrated
for centuries the pomp and ceremony of the
Church of Rome and within their walls much of
Mexico’s history was made. It is still the
headquarters of the church party while across
the plaza is the National Palace, the official home
of the government which conquered in the long
struggle between the two forces. The estimated
cost of the cathedral is $2,000,000, but that represents
only a fraction of the actual cost if the
labour is figured at a fair rate and the material
had all been purchased at market value. There
are some paintings by famous artists on the
walls and dome. A balustrade surrounds the
choir which is made of composite metal of gold,
silver and copper and is so valuable that an offer
of a speculative American to replace it with
one of equal weight in solid silver was refused.
Within the walls there are fourteen chapels
dedicated to the various saints, and candles are
kept constantly burning before the images, and
in these chapels are kept many gruesome relics
of these same saints. The remains of many of
the former viceroys and some of the other noted
men in Mexican history lie buried here. This,
the greatest church in the western world, is
also built on the foundations of the greatest
pagan temple of the continent—the imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<i>Teocalli</i> of the Aztecs. From the top of the
towers we can look upon the same valley that
Cortez viewed when Montezuma took him by
the hand after ascending the great altar, and
pointed out the various places of interest. The
lakes have receded, the architecture is different,
but our admiring eyes see the same majestic
hills on every side.</p>

<p>Listening to the bells in the towers of this
cathedral, once so powerful, one, who is a
“dreamer of dreams,” can almost imagine
them lamenting the changed times in the words
of the last poem written by the poet Longfellow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The very first movement on the part of
Protestant organizations to evangelize Mexico
was made by the American Bible Society when
they sent out one of their representative with
the American army in 1846. This man distributed
several thousand copies of the scriptures
between Vera Cruz and the capital which afterwards
bore fruit. A few years later a woman,
Miss Matilda Rankin, who had been engaged in
missionary work in Texas, crossed over the
border and held services in Monterey. In 1862
a Baptist missionary, Rev. James Hickey,
also began work in Monterey. However, no
organized effort was made by Protestant bodies
until the years from 1869 to 1880, when missionaries
were sent by the following denominations:
Protestant Episcopal, Methodist Episcopal,
Methodist Episcopal South, Presbyterian,
Baptist, Christian and Congregational. Bishop
H. C. Riley obtained an old church for the use
of the Protestant Episcopal Church and Rev.
William Butler purchased a part of the convent
of San Francisco, in the heart of the city, for
the Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>

<p><i>Dios y libertad</i> had been the watchword of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the reform movement, but it had not been put
into practice until the time of President Juarez,
who encouraged mission work, and exerted himself
to protect the missionaries from fanatics.
However frequent attacks upon these workers
were made in provincial towns and one foreign
missionary, Rev. J. L. Stephens, of the Congregational
Church, was slain at Ahualuco in 1874.
A number of native converts and preachers have
met with serious, and even fatal injuries, but
no other Americans have been killed. President
Diaz has also encouraged these ministers
when they were downhearted. Rev. William
Butler quotes an interview which several missionaries
had with him in which the President
expressed himself as follows: “I have seen
this land as none of you ever saw it, in degradation,
with everything in the line of toleration
and freedom to learn. I have watched its rise
and progress to a better condition. We are not
yet all we ought to be and hope to be; but we are
not what we once were; we have risen as a people,
and are now rising faster than ever. My
advice is, do not be discouraged. Keep on with
your work, avoiding topics of irritation and
preaching your gospel in its own spirit.” The
president has no warmer supporters than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Protestant missionaries and their little bands
of adherents.</p>

<p>Their numbers to-day after thirty years of
aggressive work seem small, as the ten Protestant
denominations who maintain missions in
Mexico only claim about twenty-five thousand
members, or about one hundred thousand adherents
including those who attend the Sunday-school
and other services. The Presbyterians
are working in fourteen different states. They
have fifty organized churches and two hundred
and twenty-two outstations which are served by
twenty-one foreign missionaries and one hundred
and one native workers. The Methodist
Episcopal Church has twenty-nine missionaries
in the field and one hundred and twenty-two
native workers, and is holding services at
more than a hundred different places. The
various denominations have divided up the field
and are working together in harmony. The
Methodists, for instance, are working in Guanajuato,
Leon, Pachuca, Puebla, Silao, and
Oaxaca. The Presbyterians have centred their
efforts in Aguas Calientes, Zacatecas, Saltillo,
San Luis Potosi and Jalapa. All denominations
have missions in the City of Mexico. The Methodists,
Baptists, Presbyterians and Congregationalists
have their own publishing houses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
issue periodicals and a great deal of printed
matter in Spanish. There are in all about two
hundred and fifty foreign missionaries in
Mexico serving about seven hundred congregations.
Many of these workers are medical missionaries
who are doing a vast amount of good,
and others are teachers who are instructing the
youth. The Protestant bodies own property
in Mexico valued at nearly two million dollars.</p>

<p>An era of at least tolerance toward Protestants
is dawning in this land, and religious liberty
is an actual fact. The Young Men’s Christian
Association has a strong organization in the
capital. A fund has recently been raised
to erect a splendid new building for the association.
The President and his cabinet
have also attended some special memorial
services in the Protestant churches. This
may seem a small thing, but a quarter of
a century ago it would have been incredible.
Some of the broad-minded Catholic clergy are
even displaying a kindlier feeling toward the
Protestant workers. It may not be many years
before Catholic clergy and Protestant ministers
may unite together in working for a common
cause—the betterment of the morals and conditions
of the people.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">PASSING OF THE LAWLESS</span></h2>

<p>A rude wooden cross set up in a pile of stones
is one of the striking features of Mexican landscape
that is frequently seen. As the train
whirls along through a narrow pass, high up on
the mountain sides the cross is seen outlined
against the sky; or, if you are pursuing your
journey by horse or mule, in the remote districts
away from the railways, your reverie is suddenly
interrupted by coming upon one of these
silent sentinels unawares. These crosses are
mute reminders of an age that is passing away.
Each one marks the spot where a murder has
taken place in times past. It is an appeal for
the good Catholic to mutter a prayer for the
soul of the murdered one, who was thus without
preparation thrust into the world beyond.
There was a time, and that not more than a
generation ago, when the murderous and lawless
classes were numerous in Mexico. The Mexican
bandit was so much feared, that, even to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
day, some hesitate to travel in that country, and
many more make walking arsenals of themselves
before turning their faces toward our
southern neighbour.</p>

<p>If the traditionary history that has come
down to us is to be believed, these robber clans
can trace their lineage back to the peregrinating
merchants of the Aztecs, and Toltecs. The rich
merchant of those days travelled over the country
visiting the various cities with his wares.
For self protection they were obliged to carry
with them a large force of armed retainers.
This knowledge of their own power led them to
violence. If, for any reason, these merchants
became angered at a town, or, if the people refused
to trade with them, they would attack it,
pillage it and carry off the inhabitants to be
sold as slaves in other remote places, or hold
them for ransom. This course generally proved
far more remunerative than the more prosaic
occupation of barter and trade. It was indeed a
strong town in those days that could afford to
refuse to trade with some of the powerful merchants.
If one trader was not strong enough
himself, he could easily enlist the assistance of
another of his class, as the loot and slaves
would be sufficient to remunerate both very well
for the undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Later came the freebooters, who, in early
Spanish days, had things very much their own
way. Although many of these were well known,
they would visit the cities armed to the teeth
and no one would dare to molest them. It is
even claimed, and with good reason, that many
officials were in league with these knights of the
road, and gave them information, and assisted
them in their plans to waylay wealthy inhabitants.
So long as the outlaws did not interfere
with matters of government, their immunity was
practically secure. There is one city in the
northern part of Mexico named Catorce, the
Spanish numeral for fourteen, because, for a
long time, it was the stronghold of fourteen of
the boldest, bravest and worst bandits that
Mexico ever produced, who terrorized the country
round about and could not be captured or
subdued.</p>

<p>After independence, came a series of revolutions
and uprisings for more than a half century.
The bandits then became guerillas, fighting on
whichever side offered the greatest advantage.
They would loot a church, or rob the hacienda
of some wealthy landowner, with equal cheerfulness.
The place or person robbed depended
upon whether the guerillas were enlisted in the
cause of the clericals, or anti-clericals. By reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of the many turmoils and fights that took
place, these guerillas became a numerous and
powerful class with their rendezvous in the
mountains, which, in no part of Mexico, are far
distant. Before the advent of the railroads and
telegraph it was a difficult matter to cope with
these robber bands in Mexico because roads
were lacking, and their haunts were almost inaccessible.
This was one of the first problems
attacked by President Diaz when he came into
power, and he did it with the boldness, originality
and dash for which he was noted.</p>

<p>This new leader found the army a disorganized
band of guerillas led by a few men,
not always over-scrupulous, and many parts of
the country overrun by bands of outlaws with
whom the local authorities were utterly unable
to cope. Having some veteran troops after his
many campaigns, Diaz sent them after the
bandits whenever opportunity afforded. They
were hunted and trailed into their mountain
fastnesses. The soldiers were instructed never
to take captives. A little heap of fresh dirt, or
a few stones, marked the place where a living
and breathing bandit had once stood. This war
of extermination made welcome to many the
proposition of Diaz. This was that he would
furnish employment to those outlaws who should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
surrender, and would grant to them protection.
The President being known as a man of his
word, this proclamation had its effect and large
numbers formerly under the ban of law, surrendered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus40">
<img src="images/illus40.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A <i>RURALE</i></p>
</div>

<p>From this class of men the first companies of
<i>rurales</i> were formed. Finding it was more
profitable, or at least safer, to be in favour with
this aggressive government than under its ban,
they willingly entered this service. These men
were brave and thoroughly familiar with all the
mountain retreats and haunts of the outlaw
bands. They hunted down their former confederates
until a live bandit was a rare specimen.
Travelling once more became secure, and
now there are few places in Mexico where it is
not perfectly safe for a traveller to journey.
The companies of rurales, of which there are
many, form one of the most effective forces for
preserving order ever devised by any government.
Like the famous <i>guardia civil</i> of Spain,
the rurales patrol the remote mountain trails
and great plains of the central plateaus, and
are in reality a body of rural police. Many a
lonely traveller has been made glad by the sight
of the gray uniform of this band. They are
generally kind hearted, and will do everything
in their power for a foreigner. Their uniform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
is the typical riding costume of the country, and
differs from the French appearance of the uniforms
of the regular army. They are fine horsemen,
expert in the use of pistol and carbine,
and form one of the most picturesque cavalry
bodies in the world.</p>

<p>There is no sickly sentimentality wasted upon
law breakers, and the highwayman, or robber,
gets little sympathy. Few criminals get a
second opportunity to commit their outrages
through the pardoning process. The old <i>ley
fuga</i>, or law of attempted escape, which was in
force under Spanish rule, under which Indians
or slaves attempting to flee were shot, was revived.
Orders were promulgated to shoot highwaymen
on sight, and all other prisoners if
escape was attempted. Few attempts to escape
are now made by prisoners, for the guards have
a reckless way of sending bullets after fleeing
prisoners, so that no chains are needed to secure
them. The bullets are swift and any one in
custody, even though held as a witness, will be
followed by the quick, death-dealing messengers,
if an attempt to escape is made. Gangs of
convicts may be seen in various places working
on the streets, or on the roads, under military
guard but without shackle. The only report
necessary in the event a prisoner is killed is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
that he attempted to escape. It may be a harsh
proceeding, but it saves the state a great deal
of money, and conviction is sure. Furthermore,
it relieves judge, jury and prison officials of
much hard work and annoyance.</p>

<p>A few years ago the Mexican army consisted
of a few thousand irregular, nondescript soldiers
so common in Spanish-American countries.
Such men it was who placed Porfirio
Diaz in power in 1876, the same year that we
were celebrating the first centennial of our independence.
In promoting peace this man of
Mexico has not forgotten the arts of war. The
army has been improved until it has ceased to
be made up of the comic-opera type of the barefooted,
half-naked soldier, and is now a well fed,
well equipped, and well clothed organization to
which Mexicans can point with pride. To the
American eye the soldiers appear rather indifferent
and insignificant, because of their smaller
stature and brown skin, which reveals the fact
that the regular soldier is generally drawn from
the lower classes of Mexicans.</p>

<p>Although Mexico might be termed a military
nation, as military service is made obligatory
by the law of the country, yet in times of peace
this service is not enforced. It is said that the
majority of the enlistments are not even voluntary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
but that recruits are drawn from the
ranks of those who are persistent law breakers—those
guilty of petty criminal offences which
we would term misdemeanours. Many of these
peon soldiers who before enlistment never
knew what it was to have regular meals and
wear clean clothes every day, leave the service
after a few years much better citizens, and
possessing a better education, for schools are
maintained in connection with all the barracks
where instruction is given in reading, writing
and mathematics. The pay is about forty cents
per day, in Mexican silver, and is good pay for
that country when you take into consideration
the fact that the soldier has absolutely no expenses
except for such luxuries as he may want.</p>

<p>The standing army of Mexico consists of
thirty thousand men and three thousand two
hundred officers. Of this number the infantry
number twenty-two thousand six hundred, cavalry
five thousand five hundred, artillery
two thousand, engineers and other branches of
the service making up the remainder. This
gives a soldier for every five hundred inhabitants,
as compared with one for every fifteen
hundred inhabitants in the United States. Both
infantry and cavalry are equipped with the
Spanish Mauser rifles and carbines. The headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of the army are in the City of Mexico,
and several battalions of infantry and regiments
of cavalry are stationed there at all times.
The country is divided into a number of districts,
at the headquarters of each of which are
stationed large bodies of troops. Nearly every
town of any size has a <i>commandancia</i> where a
few troops are quartered. This general distribution
of the military forces has been made with
a prudent foresight in order to prevent any
local uprising.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus41">
<img src="images/illus41.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ARMY HEADQUARTERS, CITY OF MEXICO</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the regular standing army,
there are a number of armed forces which would
swell the number of available troops in time of
war. First and foremost are the <i>Rurales</i> who
number about three thousand five hundred by
actual count, but double that number in effectiveness.
The Fiscal Guards number about one
thousand and are in the revenue service. The
police of the states and cities are compelled to
undergo military drill also, and could be drafted
into the army as trained soldiers. These several
forces would constitute another army
almost equal in number to the regular standing
army. Militia organizations have been provided
for by law similar to those organizations
in our own country, but as yet little has been
done. When these plans are perfected, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
designed to have the total war footing number a
force of one hundred and fifty thousand drilled
and disciplined men.</p>

<p>The President of Mexico is the commander-in-chief
of the army and navy. The “West
Point of Mexico” is located next to the presidential
residence and is called the Chapultepec
Military Academy. It was founded in 1824. During
the war of 1847 Chapultepec was successfully
stormed by the American forces, but
heroically defended by the cadets. A monument
now stands at the foot of the hill in
memory of those cadets who fell in that engagement,
and a graceful tribute is paid to the
memory of those youthful patriots on each
fourth of July, when wreaths are placed on the
monument by the American residents of the
capital at the same time that they decorate the
graves of American soldiers who are buried
near the city. This school now ranks high as a
military school, and more than one-third of the
commissioned officers of the army are graduates
of this institution. The graduate leaves this
school with the rank of lieutenant. The student
must bind himself to serve seven years in the
army, if he takes the technical courses, and, if
he is discharged, or refuses to serve, must repay
to the government $16 for each month he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
remained in the academy. If war should occur,
all retired graduates would be compelled to report
for service.</p>

<p>Not a generation ago the capital itself was the
home of innumerable thieves. In fact, a goodly
percentage of the people were either thieves,
robbers or beggars. These were drawn from
the <i>mestizo</i> class, and formed a picturesque but
filthy group of blackguards. They would
make love to any one’s pocket, and argue with
one another at the point of a long, sharp knife.
Each one carried a knife and revolver. “Unfortunate
men, women and children, the legitimate
heritage of wrong, oppression and misgovernment,
thronged the streets begging in
daytime, and committing petty robberies by
night. They slept by hundreds in doorways, on
benches in public parks, in ruined houses, and
in the dirtiest of apartments. A score or more
of filthy beings of all ages and both sexes would
sleep together in one small room reeking with
the miasma that rose from sewers and unclean
cobble-stone pavements.”</p>

<p>Vice was the natural outcome of such conditions.
All natural feelings of delicacy and
shame were deadened. Morality was unknown,
and they lived like animals rather than human
beings. Marriages were unthought of, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
children knew not their parents, for even their
mothers deserted them. If not deserted, they
were frequently maimed and turned out into
the street to beg. Pulque and mescal added its
touch to the picture. Disfiguring diseases were
added, and the name <i>leperos</i> attached to them.
Brantz Mayer, a writer on Mexico, has given
the following definition of the <i>lepero</i>. “Blacken
a man in the sun, let his hair grow long and
tangled and become filled with vermin; let him
plod about the streets in all kinds of dirt for
years, and never know the use of a brush, or
towel, or water, even, except in storms; let him
put on a pair of leather breeches at twenty and
wear them until forty without change or ablution;
and over all place a torn and blackened
hat and a tattered blanket begrimed with abominations;
let him have wild eyes and shining
teeth, features pinched by famine into sharpness,
and breast bared and browned; combine
all these in your imagination and you have a
recipe for a Mexican <i>lepero</i>.”</p>

<p>These <i>leperos</i> were the thieving class. They
frequented all parts of the city. Even the
churches were not exempt and you were just as
likely to be robbed by some apparently devout,
kneeling worshipper saying his <i>ave marias</i> in a
sacred edifice as on the street. In the less frequented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
streets many hold-ups took place, and
the bodies of those murdered would be found
on the pavement in the morning. It was hardly
safe to move about the street after night had
fallen. The thieves’ market was well known and
did a thriving business. Here were the pawn-brokers
who did a profitable business acting as
“fences” for the thieves. Many instances are
told by foreigners who were robbed, and, in a
few hours, found their property exposed for
sale in this market. They were obliged to pay
considerable sums to recover their own property.</p>

<p>All these types are now disappearing, and
even the beggars are less numerous. The former
lawless <i>leperos</i> are now seen in the poor
venders of lottery tickets who crowd every public
place. Begging is forbidden in most parts
of the city. Vice has not disappeared, it is true,
nor has it in American cities. The poor peon
still gets intoxicated and is dirty, but he is more
law-abiding than formerly. Conditions, which
are the result of neglect and misrule of centuries,
can only be overcome entirely by education,
immigration and the infusion of saner
ideas, and this is a gradual process. A whole
city, or a whole country, can not be plowed up
and re-sown in a season, as the corn fields of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
last year were transformed into the waving
fields of golden grain this year. A generation is
even too short a time. The change actually
wrought has been almost a miracle. Work can
now be had by all who are willing to work, and
the government is making strenuous efforts to
get rid of the idle classes. It is a long and hard
task, but another decade under present conditions
will work wonders.</p>

<p>An excellent police system is found in the
capital and all the other cities. A policeman is
not hard to find. One is stationed at nearly
every street intersection. During the day he
stands like a statue, occasionally leaning against
a door post. At night the policeman brings a
lantern and a blanket, and sets the lantern in
the centre of the crossing, while he stands beside
it or not far away. The joker says the lantern
is intended to aid the thief in avoiding the
officer of the law. Sometimes after the people
quit passing, he may lean up against a building
and fall asleep, but you can locate his vicinity
by the lantern. As the windows are all heavily
barred, and the doors are heavy oaken affairs
that it would take a stick of dynamite to move,
and as fires are infrequent, his lot is not a very
hard one. The police are very numerous, however,
because the government wants to keep informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
in order that a revolutionary movement
may not gain any headway. One seldom hears
of knock-downs now, and pocket picking is about
the only kind of robbery.</p>

<p>These guardians of the peace are generally
called <i>serenos</i>. This name clings to them from
the old Spanish watchman whose duty it was to
call out the time of the night and state of the
weather. As this was usually clear, the watchman
would say “<i>tiempo sereno</i>” meaning
“weather clear.” From the frequent repetition
of this term the watchmen were dubbed <i>serenos</i>.
The Mexican <i>sereno</i> is generally a faithful and
reliable official and is obliging to a stranger.
They have made the streets in the City of
Mexico as safe as in Paris. The senses of sight
and smell may be offended more often, but purse
and life are just as secure.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE STORY OF THE REPUBLIC</span></h2>

<p>There is a strange fascination about the history
of Mexico, and no one can thoroughly understand
the country or the people without a
little insight into those stirring events that preceded
the establishment of the present republic.
With the increasing friendly regard and the
growing commercial intercourse between the
two countries, a few pages devoted to this subject
will not be amiss; and the prospective
traveller, as well as the one who has already
travelled in that country, will find an additional
interest in Mexico and the Mexicans.</p>

<p>However we may feel inclined to criticize
Cortez, the fact remains that he thoroughly subjugated
the country, and presented to Spain the
fairest jewel of her domain. Having been made
the first governor of New Spain, he was too
busy with fresh conquests and the task of keeping
order to make a successful ruler. In order to
reform the various abuses that had grown up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
and represent in every way possible the person
of the king, King Charles V sent the first
viceroy in the autumn of 1535. This first of a
long line of viceroys, reaching down to the year
1821, was named Antonio de Mendoza, himself
of noble descent, a man of ability, and one who
had at heart the best interests of the colonists
and the welfare of the Indians. The latter had
been subjected to many humiliations and hardships
all of which were removed by him, and
they were encouraged in the cultivation of the
lands.</p>

<p>The colonists themselves were a source of
great trouble for they were mostly adventurers
and were not, like the early American colonists,
men who were seeking religious liberty. The
arm of the church was stretched just as strongly
in new Spain as in the land of their birth, and to
the religious orders was due in great measure
the firm foundation upon which the Spanish
government was established. During the rule
of this man and his successor, Velasco, the country
prospered, agriculture was stimulated and
a number of industries suitable to the climate of
the country encouraged.</p>

<p>At the close of the sixteenth century, Spain
underwent great changes. The line of able
rulers had passed away, and the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
fell into the hands of profligates who were
favourites of the reigning sovereign. The line
of viceroys continued in rotation, and most of
them were fair men who probably governed the
best they knew how, but their knowledge on that
subject was not very great. They were poor
rulers when compared with the first two above
mentioned. The church retained its firm grasp.
As one writer has put it, during the first century
of Spanish rule the church was a blessing to the
country, during the second an indifferent
quantity and during the third an actual menace.
The inquisition—that terrible institution—had
been established in Mexico as early as
1570. The first <i>auto-da-fé</i> was celebrated in
1574, when “there perished twenty-one pestilent
Lutherans.” Indians were exempt from
this institution and it was only aimed at heretics
of other nations. Large numbers were burned
in the capital and other cities. In Puebla, the
old house of the inquisition was remodelled
within the last half-century, and a number of
walled-up cells opened in which skeletons were
found—no doubt remains of victims who had
been buried alive. The inquisition was not
formally abolished until the beginning of the
last century, just prior to the beginning of the
movement for independence. Even this concession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and the promise of correcting other
abuses, did not stop the growing discontent, for
generations had grown up who had few ties
linking them to the mother country; who had
intermarried with native races; and who would
be satisfied with nothing but complete severance
of their relations.</p>

<p>The beginning of the nineteenth century
opened with a feeling of unrest in all European
nations and their colonies. When Napoleon
overturned monarchies, the idea of the divine
right of kings received a shock. Among the
countries thus affected was Spain, which had
dropped down from the high pedestal it had
formerly occupied. The eyes of the people of
Mexico were opened by the events in Europe,
and also by the successful revolution of the
American colonies. All the offices of profit in
Mexico were held by Spaniards, and the policy
of the mother country toward her dependents
was well expressed by one of the viceroys as
follows: “Let the people of these dominions
learn once for all that they were born to be
silent and to obey, and not to discuss nor to have
opinions in political affairs.” The spirit of
revolution and liberty was in the air and restraint
became more and more galling. The
events leading to the independence of Mexico,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
and the stirring times subsequent thereto, can
best be treated by a glance at the men who were
in the limelight during the various periods.</p>

<p>When Miguel Hidalgo, curate of the little
village of Dolores, sounded the “grito” of
independence by ringing the bell of the parish
church early on the morning of the 16th of
September, 1810, a struggle for independence
was started that lasted for eleven years, and
during which much of the soil of Mexico was
crimsoned with the blood of those slain in battle
or executed by the authorities as traitors. At
the outset no people were less prepared for such
a contest. They knew nothing of military
tactics; their weapons were primitive and their
leaders were without military training. No
more righteous cause ever existed for rebellion
against tyranny and usurpation. The first two
leaders were consecrated representatives of the
church that had assisted a despotic government
in bringing about such an unfortunate state of
affairs. These two martyrs who were excommunicated
by the church, and executed by the
government as traitors, are now honoured
with resting places in sacred ground by a grateful
nation.</p>

<p>The first revolt was headed by a picture of
the patron saint of the country, and shouts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
“Viva Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe” and
“Viva la Independencia” were intermingled.
Hidalgo and his compatriots were compelled to
begin their movement before thoroughly prepared,
because their plans had been discovered
and betrayed to the government. On the morning
of the memorable day above mentioned,
Hidalgo addressed the people from the pulpit
of the church where he had so often celebrated
mass, and, leading his followers forth, released
the prisoners in the town, and captured the
principal Spaniards. Soon afterwards this
priest-warrior patriot, who had been named
Captain-General, followed by a few hundred
of human beings (they can not be called soldiers),
marched forth to conquer Mexico and
give “death to the Spaniards.”</p>

<p>It was a motley crowd armed with stones,
lances, <i>machetes</i>, arrows, clubs and swords,
whose numbers and enthusiasm were ever increasing
as they marched across the country
without meeting resistance. San Miguel and
Celaya, Irapuato and Querétero, yielded, and
the army which by this time numbered tens of
thousands marched towards Guanajuato. The
governor of that province assembled the terror-stricken
populace in the now famous Alhondiga
de Granaditas, built for storing grain but now a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
prison, as noted in that city as the Bastille of
Paris. Upon a refusal to surrender, Hidalgo
and his followers attacked this fortress with
fanatical zeal, and captured it by the mere force
of numbers. This supplied him with plenty of
food and a million dollars in money which furnished
the sinews of war.</p>

<p>Terror struck the hearts of the Spaniards and
every town yielded to this new leader, who now
bore the title of Generalissimo, as the army approached
the City of Mexico. One terrible battle
occurred at Monte las Cruces and both forces
withdrew. Hidalgo—and this was probably
his greatest error—retreated, and his fortune
immediately turned. The volatile nature of the
people asserted itself and his followers deserted
by the thousands. He started for the United
States, but was betrayed and captured, and was
executed at Chihuahua on July 31st, 1811. For
ten years his head was suspended by a spike
from one of the corners of the Alhondiga de
Granaditas, once occupied by him as conqueror,
as a warning to revolutionists, but was afterward
buried with great ceremony in the cathedral
at the capital.</p>

<p>It was around a disciple of Hidalgo that the
forces of discontent and patriotism rallied upon
the death of their first leader, and that man was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
also a priest, Jose Maria Morelas. Of low birth
and poor, this man drove mules until thirty
years of age before an opportunity presented
itself for education to fit himself for the priesthood,
which was his ambition. In that time he
had acquired the qualities of patience and cool
calculation from the animals he drove. A
student under Hidalgo, he had imbibed a love
for independence, and leaving his church upon
the sounding of the “grito,” offered his services
to the Generalissimo. He was an abler
leader than Hidalgo and showed great military
skill, winning a series of victories clear across
the country from Acapulco, on the Pacific Coast,
to Cuautla not far from Vera Cruz. At Cuautla
he was besieged for over two months, and then
successfully withdrew with all his forces by
night. Returning to Acapulco he summoned the
first Mexican Congress, which met at Chilpantzingo,
a small town near that city. This
congress met on the 14th of September, 1813,
and on the following day issued its famous
declaration of independence, as follows:—“The
Congress of Anahuac, lawfully installed
in the city of Chilpantzingo, of North America,
solemnly declares, in the presence of God, arbitrator
of kingdoms and author of society, who
gives and takes away according to the inscrutable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
designs of his providence, that,
through the present circumstances of Europe,
it has recovered the exercise of its sovereignty,
hitherto usurped, its dependence upon the
throne of Spain being thus forever disrupted
and dissolved.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This congress provided a form of government
with a military executive called Generalissimo,
and Morelas was elected to this position
for life, or “so long as he was worthy.”
Shortly after this his forces were defeated at
Valladolid, now called Morelia, and his power
began to wane, though resistance was kept up
for some time afterwards with varying success.
Spanish troops had arrived, and stronger
leaders were in charge of the government
forces and the cause of independence looked
dark. The plans of Morelas were betrayed to
the enemy and he was captured. The ecclesiastical
tribunes covered him with ignominy. He
was then sentenced to death by the military authorities,
and shot in the little village of San
Cristobal Ecatepec, near the capital, on December
22d, 1815, dying the death of a hero. This
muleteer-priest-warrior was an able leader, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
honest man and a patriotic citizen. He seemed
devoid of personal ambition, although accepting
title for the sake of the cause he fought for. He
was possessed of restless energy and great
piety, for he always made confession before
entering battle. To-day, he is second only to
Hidalgo in the affections of the people, and
worthily fills that position. Over the door of
the house once owned by him in Morelia appears
the following inscription:—</p>

<p class="center">“Morelas the illustrious<br />
Immortal Hero.<br />
In this house honoured by thy presence<br />
Salute you the grateful people of Morelia.”</p>

<p>The revolution was seemingly crushed at the
death of Morelas but a few patriots retired to
the mountains, and there kept alive for better
days the sacred fire of liberty. Guerrero was
one of those heroes who showed an unwearying
activity, and kept up a constant warfare upon
the government forces. The next prominent
name in succession among those leaders of the
movement for freedom was Agustin de Iturbide,
a former active and able officer of the royalist
forces, and to whom more than anyone else was
due the failure of Morelas. Deserting the cause
of Spain, because he thought injustice had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
done him, General Iturbide issued the “Plan of
Iguala” on the 20th of February, 1820, composed
of three articles: preservation of the
Roman Catholic church; independence of
Mexico under a monarchical form of government
with a prince of the royal house of Spain
as ruler; union and equality of Spaniards and
Mexicans. From this proclamation his army became
known as the army of the three guarantees.
His act was full of duplicity, for he had
obtained the largest force possible from the
Viceroy Apodaca in order to turn them over to
the new scheme.</p>

<p>Before the viceroy could recover from his
surprise, Iturbide, who had been joined by most
of the insurgent leaders, had started on his
victorious campaign. Valladolid, Querétero and
Puebla succumbed. The viceroy tried by suppressing
liberty, and enforcing enlistments in
the royal army, to stem the tide but in vain, and
he was deposed. O’Donoju, the sixty-fourth
and last viceroy, arrived about this time at Vera
Cruz, but was intercepted by Iturbide and entered
into the treaty of Cordoba in which the
independence of Mexico was recognized with a
sovereign to be selected from the royal house of
Spain, and a provisional Junta formed. Iturbide
was selected as president of this Junta, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
made a triumphal entry into the City of Mexico
on the 27th of September, 1821. This ended
three hundred years of Spanish rule in Mexico.
Iturbide had accomplished in a little more than
a year, and with little bloodshed, what ten years
of strife had failed to do. He can not be classed
with Hidalgo and Morelas as a pure patriot,
but he has been officially designated as the
“Liberator of Mexico.”</p>

<p>The rejection of the treaty of Cordoba by the
Cortes of Spain gave new impetus to the smouldering
ambitions of Iturbide. The second
Mexican Congress having been called, Iturbide
at a packed session was declared Emperor by a
majority of four to one of those voting, but not
a constitutional majority, and he took the office
as Agustin I. When he was crowned and
anointed in the cathedral with much form and
solemnity, on the 21st of July, 1822, the ambition
of this self-made emperor had reached
its full. The saying that uneasy lies the head
that wears a crown never had better application
than in this instance. Other leaders in the
cause of liberty felt that they had been slighted,
and every discontented person made common
cause against the Emperor. A republic was
proclaimed at Vera Cruz in December of the
same year by Santa Anna, who was commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of a regiment stationed there, and he issued a
<i>pronunciamento</i>. This plan failed, but it encouraged
Bravo, Guerrero and other revolutionary
leaders, and rebellion sprung up in a number
of places. Iturbide had dissolved congress
and this increased the dissatisfaction. A more
formidable revolt arose, and on March 19th,
1823, Iturbide abdicated without attempting to
retain his position by force of arms.</p>

<p>A few weeks later the ex-Emperor left
Mexico and sailed for Italy, having been granted
an annual sum of $25,000 for his services. He
soon went to England and wrote the government
from there that the republic was in danger, and
he would come back to help fight the battles of
his country. He did not know that his death
had been decreed by congress, and so he set
sail upon his last voyage. When he arrived at
Vera Cruz he was captured, and after some delay
was executed at Padilla on the 19th of July,
1824, as a traitor, in his forty-first year. His
body was buried in a roofless old church and lay
there until 1838, when it was removed to the
Cathedral.</p>

<p>Opinion is very much divided as to the rank
that should be accorded Iturbide. He was able,
brave, honest so far as is known, and probably
fell a victim to his ambition like many a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
before him. The relative regard in which he
is held is shown in the fact that the town which
gave both him and his former vanquished foe,
Morelas, birth, is now called Morelia, and a state
is also named Morelas. In contrast to this there
is neither city nor state named after Iturbide,
and the famous Iturbide Hotel in the capital
city, once his residence, is the only institution
perpetuating his name so far as I could learn.
The only things accomplished by him during his
brief reign were the settlement of the titles by
which he and his family should be addressed,
the succession to the throne, order of precedence
among the dignitaries, allowances of himself
and family, and the creation of the Order of
Guadalupe to bestow honours upon his followers.</p>

<p>At last a so-called republic was established,
and Guadalupe Victoria was inaugurated as the
first president on the 10th day of October, 1824,
and served until 1828. When the fort of San
Juan de Ulua at Vera Cruz lowered its flag, in
1825, the last vestige of Spanish power was
gone, and the red and yellow striped banner of
the Iberian peninsula was not to be seen on
Mexican soil. And Mexico, as then constituted,
was a big country, containing almost twice as
much territory as to-day. From the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
administration of President Victoria until after
the death of Maximilian, there was not a year
of peace in Mexico. Revolutions, <i>pronunciamentos</i>,
“plans” and restorations followed
each other in quick succession. Generals, presidents
and dictators sprang up like mushrooms,
and their position was as evanescent. The congress
unwisely decreed the expulsion of the
Spaniards, and their departure took much of the
wealth of the country. Revolutions were an
every-day affair. A man in position of authority
did not know when his time to be shot
might come. A sudden turn of fortune might
send him either to the national palace, or before
a squad of men with guns aimed at his heart.</p>

<p>A good illustration of this uncertainty of affairs
is seen in the treatment and fate of the
grim old patriot Guerrero. Born of very low
Indian parents he had climbed to the front and
borne many of the burdens of the struggle with
Spain. He cheerfully yielded his command to
the renegade Iturbide, and fought valiantly
under that leader for liberty. By a turn of
fortune he became the third president in 1829.
A few months later he was compelled to flee,
but was soon afterwards betrayed and captured
at Acapulco. At a farcical trial he was condemned
to death as “morally incapable” to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
act as president, and shot on the 15th of February,
1831, at Cuilapa. Soon afterwards he
was declared a martyr and his body removed
to the capital with honours. Two monuments
to this martyr now adorn that city, and a state
has been named after him. Under his short rule
slavery was abolished by statute.</p>

<p>Elections eventually became a farce. The unfortunate
habit was acquired of appealing to
arms instead of submitting to the result of the
ballot. The trouble was that the people had
copied the letter, and not the spirit of the American
constitution. Liberty was interpreted as
license, after their exaggerated ideas of the former.
The scheming politicians would hesitate
at nothing—revolution or civil war—to attain
private ends or personal aggrandizement. A
general indolence of character, and the hindrances
to the acquirement of property among
the masses, made the people more willing to
yield to disturbing and designing politicians.
They are impetuous by nature, impatient of restraint
and easily fired up. The rapid changes
in government can be seen when you read that
there were five different presidents in each of
the years 1846 and 1847, and four in 1855—not
an evidence of tranquillity at least. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
leading parties constantly at war were the
“progresistas” and “retrogrados.”</p>

<p>During this period a few prominent names
are constantly recurring, and by far the most
prominent one is that of the notorious Santa
Anna, who, for more than fifty years, occupied
a prominent, but not always honourable, place
in Mexican affairs. Earlier in life his restless
energy was expended in a fairly commendable
way, and he fought some battles in defense of
the rights of the people. During the war of intervention
with France in 1838 he lost his leg in
the defense of Vera Cruz. Ever afterwards,
when in trouble, he would flourish his severed
limb and remind the people how he had been
mutilated in the defense of his country, with the
effect of restoring himself in public favour.
As he grew older his naturally quarrelsome disposition
increased, his vanity knew no bounds,
and when at the height of his glory, he declared
himself dictator and ordered all people
to address him as “most serene highness.”
Never honest except as a matter of policy, his
cupidity became more pronounced, until, near
the close of the war with the United States, he
offered to appoint commissioners and confirm
a treaty of peace for the sum of one million dollars.
First elected president in 1833, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
again either chosen to, or assumed the office, in
1839, 1846, 1847, 1853 and 1855, but did not serve
long at any time. On one occasion his amputated
leg was buried with great ceremony, but
afterwards fickle sentiment changed, and the
martyr part of this hero was brought forth by
the rabble, dragged through the streets of the
capital, and insulting epithets heaped upon the
former idol.</p>

<p>Santa Anna led the forces against the Texas
insurrectionists, and was the man responsible
for the Alamo slaughter, when one hundred and
forty brave Texans were trapped and slain.
Visitors to that place are still shown the stains
made by the blood of that brave frontiersman,
Davy Crockett, and the cry of “Remember the
Alamo” still has potency. This insurrection
was soon followed by the war between Mexico
and the United States.</p>

<p>Franklin says, there never was a good war
nor a bad peace. The United States can not be
justified in warring upon Mexico, though the results
have perhaps been for the best with both
nations. Bancroft does not mince words in his
treatment of the subject for he says: “It (the
Mexican War) was a premeditated and predetermined
affair; it was the result of a deliberately
calculated scheme of robbery on the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
of the superior force.” The result was a foregone
conclusion, for Mexico, torn by internal
dissensions, impoverished by the expense of
revolutions and official robbery, and with a government
changing with every change of the
seasons, had neither armies, money nor supplies
for such a conflict. The people were used
to the smell of powder but were not trained soldiers,
and the “generals” were simply a few
of the twelve thousand recipients of military
commissions that had been distributed by
various presidents in the preceding three years.
“Plans” promulgated by one party were bombarded
with “pronunciamentos” from another.
This was the condition of affairs when General
Taylor assumed the offensive and fought the
battle of Palo Alto.</p>

<p>Mexico might have sued for peace at this time,
but no government was in power long enough
to negotiate a treaty. A special envoy sent from
Washington at the request of one president was
refused an audience by a new one, who had
usurped the office before his arrival. Generals
Taylor and Fremont subdued Northern Mexico,
and General Scott later began his memorable
march toward the ancient Aztec capital, from
Vera Cruz, like Cortez of old. Santa Anna, who
had been “recuperating” from public unpopularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
at Havana, returned and state after state
immediately “pronounced” in his favour. He
issued a manifesto assuming the executive control
and took the field against the invaders. He
first tried to secure $15,000,000 from the Church,
but although the priests hated the “northern
heretics” they were loth to give up the coin,
and little was secured. Vera Cruz fell after two
weeks’ bombardment, and Puebla yielded to the
Americans. Patriotism was finally aroused to
save the City of Mexico, but the victories of
Chapultepec, Chorubusco and Molino del Rey
were followed by the triumphal entry of General
Scott into the capital. The treaty of
Guadalupe-Hidalgo ceded to the United States
more than six hundred thousand square miles of
the Mexican domain, including some of the
richest mineral lands of the republic. Disgraced
and humiliated as Mexico had been, it was, I believe,
the beginning of better things for that
country.</p>

<p>Santa Anna went into voluntary exile to
Jamaica. The first president after the war,
Herrera, actually served the appointed time of
his office, but disorder soon began under his
successor. “Pronouncing” became popular
again, and Santa Anna returned. He was made
dictator for a short time by his favourites. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
was the last office held by this selfish politician.
He exiled himself to St. Thomas again, and
afterwards in Elizabethport, New Jersey. During
the second empire he tried to curry favour
with both sides, but neither would listen to him.
Discouraged and disheartened he lived abroad,
until, burdened by the weight of eighty years, he
sought and obtained permission to return to
the capital, and died on the 20th of June, 1876.
Thus passed a man who had lived in stirring
times, was most intensely hated, had been
president six times, military dictator four times,
had upset fifteen governments, had been marked
for the assassin’s bullet many times; and yet
he lived to a ripe old age and died a natural
death. However, all his glory had faded, and,
blind, lame and infirm, he spent his last days in
extreme poverty.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of this man drawn by
Rev. William Butler,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who visited him about a
year before his death: “Santa Anna was living
in an obscure street, neglected and forgotten by
all parties. On entering the apartment we found
the old man sitting on a sofa, behind which hung
a picture of his wife ‘her serene highness,
Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna’ arrayed as a
vice-queen. The magnificence of the painting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
contrasted sadly with the poverty-stricken aspect
of the room and furniture. To him, however,
this could make but little difference, as we
soon saw that he was totally blind as well as
feeble and broken in spirit, with a tendency to
mental weakness.” He was buried in the cemetery
at Guadalupe without honours or recognition
by the government, and his remains still
rest there. As I gazed upon his tomb I could not
help thinking what a contrast between his career
and that of the patriots Hidalgo, Morelas, and
Juarez.</p>

<p>The early constitution had declared that the
Roman Catholic religion should perpetually be
the religion of Mexico. Nevertheless a struggle
had been growing up between the clericals and
liberals for many years with increasing intensity.
It finally centred in a struggle over the
sequestration of the church property, and became
wider and wider until the whole country
was involved and divided into two great parties.
The liberals were probably just as good Christians
as the others but thought the Church had
too much wealth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;" id="illus42">
<img src="images/illus42.jpg" width="420" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A VILLAGE CHURCH</p>
</div>

<p>At this juncture there arose a pure Indian,
of lowly parentage, who never saw a school until
he was twelve years of age. His name was
Benito Juarez. Although ever professing devout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
faith, he early espoused the cause of the
anti-clerical party. He was banished by Santa
Anna and fled to New Orleans, but opinion
changed and his sentiments became the popular
views. The new constitution of 1857 declared
the separation of church and state. Juarez had
been elected President of the Supreme Court
under Comonfort. The latter was compelled to
flee the country and Juarez became president
under the constitution, in 1857. Congress
passed a law confiscating church property and
civil war was begun. Juarez took the field in
person and did not reach the capital until three
years later. These three years have been called
the years of horrors. The liberals were excommunicated
by the church, and the papal delegate
and several bishops were ordered out of the
country in turn by Juarez. Ministerial crises
and resignations became chronic. Guerillas and
robbers were bold and attacked many aliens,
and foreign obligations were unpaid because of
the impoverished condition of the country.</p>

<p>Juarez alone remained cool in the midst of all
these disturbances. The convention entered
into between France, England and Spain for a
joint intervention in Mexican affairs on the 31st
day of October, 1861, brought new embarrassment
to the Indian reformer. Underneath these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
acts of the convention the crafty hand of Napoleon
can be seen. The man who had accomplished
one <i>coup d’Etat</i> was a sworn enemy to
all republican institutions. The pretext for this
intervention was the collection of some money
claims and reparation for alleged offences.
Spain no doubt looked forward to a little revenge.
The Spanish fleet occupied Vera Cruz
on the 14th of December, 1861, followed by the
other armies. A conference took place at
Orizaba with Juarez who acknowledged the
money claims, and Spain and England withdrew
their forces. The French remained,
secretly supported and encouraged by the extreme
church party, and advanced to and
captured Puebla. Distracted and disheartened
by the state of affairs, the prospect of a stable
government made the way easy to place Maximilian
upon the throne as Emperor of Mexico,
and this was done. He and the empress arrived
on the 28th of May, 1864. Maximilian was a
liberal ruler and the Empress Carlotta won the
people by her charming personality and benevolences.</p>

<p>As long as the French forces remained his
throne was secure. The prompt and decisive
action of Secretary Seward sounded the death
knell of Maximilian’s ambitions. Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
withdrew his troops, and Maximilian might have
easily escaped had he not wavered between
ambition and discretion,—the former eventually
winning. He met death with dignity and
said “May my blood be the last spilt for the
welfare of the country.”</p>

<p>During all of these years Juarez maintained
a semblance of authority and kept a cabinet under
appointment although he was finally driven
to the American border. Yet he could wait, for
he had inherited from his dusky ancestors the
qualities of patience, endurance and imperturbability.
He also had executive ability and
an abundance of good sense. After the execution
of Maximilian he made a triumphal entry
into Mexico. The country was impoverished.
The short empire had added a national debt of
$187,000,000. More than one thousand battles
and skirmishes had occurred between 1863 and
1867, and a hundred thousand Mexicans had
been killed or disabled. The people were still
restless and an increasing element began to say
that he had been president long enough. He
was unmoved, but kept steadily on his way trying
to better the condition of the people, improve
the finances and bring prosperity to his
country. The iron constitution finally gave way
and he died on the 19th of July, 1872, beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
and honoured by his country. He deserves to
be called the Washington of Mexico, for the
real liberty of a republican form of government
began with him. He had prepared the
way for his successors to bring peace, prosperity
and liberty to a country that for centuries
had been groping and striving after such
a condition. Juarez lies buried beneath a magnificent
monument in the Panteon de San Fernando,
in the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Juarez the constitutional
succession to the chief magistracy fell upon
Lerdo de Tejada, who occupied that office for
four years. The subsequent history of Mexico,
however, centres around the personality of
Porfirio Diaz, and the events of his long administration
and final downfall are treated in the
two following chapters.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GUIDING HAND</span></h2>

<p>“I should like to live fifty years to see the
result of the seed I have planted,” said Porfirio
Diaz a number of years ago. It is not within
the limit of human possibility that such a boon
could be granted this amiable “republican
despot” but he had lived long enough to see the
good results of the policies established by him
for the upbuilding of his country.</p>

<p>Succeeding to a government that had been
in the throes of revolution ever since the patriot-priest
Hidalgo first proclaimed independence
on the 16th of September, 1810, President Diaz
at once restored peace to the country that has
lasted for thirty years. Inheriting a bankrupt
treasury from his predecessors, and a large
foreign debt that had on several occasions
brought about foreign intervention, he succeeded
in placing the finances of the country
in a prosperous condition and has accomplished
more for Mexico than had been done in three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
centuries of Spanish rule. He organized the
army along modern lines and established the
<i>rurales</i> which insured the safety of life and
property. Railroads under the wise system of
encouragement inaugurated by him have increased
from three hundred and fifty miles to
thirteen thousand five hundred miles; telegraph
lines from four thousand five hundred miles to
thirty-five thousand miles; the number of post-offices
now number two thousand three hundred
and fifty instead of seven hundred and twenty as
it was in 1876. Imports and exports have
doubled several times, and the annual balance
sheet now shows a comfortable surplus instead
of a deficit as in former days. All this has been
done and old obligations met in spite of the
serious loss in exchange due to the depreciation
in silver, and the fact that the heavy foreign
obligations had to be met in gold purchased with
silver at a low and constantly varying valuation.</p>

<p>The life of Porfirio Diaz is fascinating. It
savours of the days of knighthood and romance.
We are reminded of those heroes of old around
whom time has cast a glamour, for he has had
adventures as exciting, escapes as miraculous
and a life seemingly as charmed as any hero
created by the masters of romance, and his life
may well be termed “stranger than fiction.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
One is naturally inclined to be rather eulogistic
in his treatment of such a character.</p>

<p>The present President of Mexico was born in
the city of Oaxaca in an unimposing house on
the Street of La Soledad, that is now used as a
sugar factory, on the 15th of September, 1830,
a day already celebrated in Mexican annals. His
father, Captain José Faustini Diaz, was of
Spanish descent and followed the occupation of
innkeeper, but died when Porfirio was only
three years of age. His maternal grandmother
was a Mixteca Indian. The church and law were
the only two occupations open to an ambitious
youth in those days, and this young lad was intended
for the former. He chose the law much
to the disgust of his relatives but never followed
that calling. The fighting blood in him impelled
him to the sanguinary conflicts on the field
rather than the bloodless battles in the courts
between contending counsel.</p>

<p>About this time the war with the United
States broke out and the future president, a
youth of seventeen, volunteered but saw no
fighting, although he thus early in life showed
his genius for organization by forming his fellow-students
of the academy into a battalion
for the defence of his home city. Benito Juarez,
afterwards president, was attracted by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
youth and invited him to read law in his office,
which offer was accepted. Thus was begun an
association between two men who were
destined in later years to occupy such a prominent
place in Mexican history. Through the influence
of Juarez, the younger man was made
assistant librarian and by the aid of the salary
attached to this position, and money earned as
tutor, he completed his course, and received his
law degree.</p>

<p>Politics and war seem to have divided the
attention of Diaz from the very first with a preference
for the latter in early life. Diaz was a
military genius. I can say this in all seriousness.
Although he never commanded a large
army yet, under his hands, the rawest recruits
soon became valuable troops. He is possessed
of a personal magnetism and the quality of
<i>simpatica</i>, (which can not be translated into
English) that draws people to him and, when
once aroused, they become his enthusiastic
partisans. In a land of lethargy and procrastination
his movements were quick and decisive,
and he soon became noted for night marches and
early morning attacks. He never was overcome
except by superior forces, and then only after
his stores and ammunition were exhausted.
Even when beaten and his army captured or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
separated, a few days of freedom would again
place him at the head of a respectable force
ready to take aggressive stand against the
enemy. Had he been in command of a hundred
thousand men, he would have met the situation
with the same tact and ability.</p>

<p>The first of the many political offices held by
Diaz was that of Jefe Politico, or mayor, of the
little Indian town of Ixtlan when only twenty-five
years of age. Here he devoted his time to
organizing the Indians into a company of
militia, and this little body of soldiers formed a
nucleus that proved a great help to him in the
troublous times which followed. Later he was
made Jefe of Tehuantepec where he showed
great administrative ability. Soon afterward,
in 1861, he was elected a deputy to congress from
Oaxaca, but at that time would not sacrifice the
excitement of war for the more prosaic duties of
law-making.</p>

<p>Captain Diaz had seen his first military service
in the revolts against the notorious Santa
Anna, of Alamo fame. He had the courage to
sign a remonstrance against this usurper, and
was compelled to fly for his life. Later, in the
campaigns against Santa Anna, he was so successful
that he had become almost a hero in the
eyes of his fellow Oaxacans. At the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
of the French invasion, the rank of general of
a brigade had been conferred upon him at the
early age of thirty-two years, and he was assigned
to the defense of Puebla under General
Zaragoza. It was due to his tactics more than
anything else that the way was paved for the
great victory of <i>Cinco de Mayo</i>, 1862, when an
inferior force of Mexicans defeated a numerically
larger army of veteran French troops. It
was nearly a year later before the armies of the
allied French and Austrians, greatly augmented
by new arrivals, were able to capture Puebla
after a two months’ siege, the ammunition of
the Mexicans had been exhausted. General Diaz
refusal to give <i>parol</i> and was made prisoner
but escaped after a short confinement.</p>

<p>Because of the approach of the invading
armies toward the capital, President Juarez had
removed the seat of government to San Luis
Potosi. He made General Diaz commander-in-chief
of the armies south of the Valley of
Mexico. Returning to his favourite haunts in
Oaxaca, he soon gathered together an army and
some money and marched forth on the offensive.
By this time General Diaz had become such a
formidable opponent that General Bazaine himself,
later of European fame, leader of the
French forces, took the field against this young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
leader with the determination to crush him. He
finally shut him up in Oaxaca and captured that
city in 1865. The French general had carefully
laid his plans for this campaign, having transported
a large number of guns, and was at the
head of an army, Diaz claims, of sixteen thousand.
The fame of this general and his large
force created a panic among the troops of Diaz
and his little army had dwindled to a few hundred.
General Diaz was captured and taken to
Puebla by his captors where he was prisoner for
more than seven months in a former house of the
Jesuits in that city. His escape is celebrated
in Mexican annals, and his own account is as
follows, although I have greatly abbreviated
it:—</p>

<p>“After taps for silence had been sounded for
the night, I went to a room which was roofless
and which on that account was used as a yard.
I had with me three ropes, wrapped up in
canvas, and I threw them onto the roof. I also
had another rope, and I succeeded in throwing
it around a projecting stone spout which seemed
to be sufficiently firm. When I had satisfied myself
that the support was sufficient, I climbed
up by the rope to the roof. My progress along
the roof to the corner of San Roque street,
where I had made up my mind to descend, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
attended with much danger, for on the roof of
the church a detachment and sentries were stationed
to keep watch. Gliding on all-fours I
made towards the point where I was to let myself
down. I often had to stop to feel my way,
for the roof was strewn with many fragments of
glass which sounded when touched. Moreover,
there were frequent flashes of lightning, which
exposed me to being discovered.</p>

<p>“I finally reached the wall of the church. In
order to arrive at the corner of the street of San
Roque it was necessary to pass through a portion
of the edifice which was occupied by the
priest in charge of the church, and I was aware
that shortly before he had denounced to the
court martial some political prisoners who had
bored a hole through their place of confinement
into his dwelling, and as a consequence they had
been shot the next day.</p>

<p>“I let myself down into an upper yard of the
priest’s house at the moment when a young man
who also lived there had come in from the street;
he had probably been to the theatre, for he was
in gay humour and was humming an air from an
operetta. He did not see me as he passed, and
I remained quiet until he had entered his room.
When I considered that sufficient time had
elapsed for him to get into bed, and perhaps to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
fall asleep, I climbed to the roof of the convent
on the opposite side to that by which I had descended
and pushed forward to the corner of the
street of San Roque, and I arrived there at
last. There is at the corner, in a niche, a
statue of St. Vincent Ferrer which I proposed
using to fix the rope by which I was to descend.
The saint wobbled when touched, but probably
there was inside the statue an iron spike to hold
it. In any case, in order to be more sure, I
adjusted the rope around the pedestal of the
statue which seemed to be quite firm. I resolved
to alight in a vacant lot which adjoined
and which was only fenced in. I did not know
that there was a drove of hogs in this yard. As
when I began the descent I turned somewhat
with my rope, my back struck against the wall,
and the impact caused a poniard which I carried
at my waist to fall from its sheath among
the hogs, probably wounding one of them, for
they set up a grunting which grew louder as
they saw me descending among them. I had to
wait for some time for them to quiet down. I
then climbed to the top of the partition separating
the lot from the street, but I had at once to
bob down again for just at that moment a
gendarme was passing on his round, seeing if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the doors were well fastened. When he had retired
I sprang into the street.”</p>

<p>In a few days he had rallied around him a
few faithful followers and captured the small
garrison of Tehuitzingo. From this time his
career was a succession of victories until the
capture and execution of Maximilian. These
victories and the firm stand of the United States
government re-established republican supremacy.
Early in 1867 preparations were made
to regain Puebla which city was defended by a
force of several thousand French troops. On
April 2nd he made a feint with a few hundred
men on the convent of “El Carmen” which
caused the army of the defenders to be concentrated
there. Then a concerted attack followed
from several points, and the soldiers of
Diaz drove back the hardened troops of the
third Napoleon, and the flag of liberty waved
over the city in the early dawn. He followed up
the fleeing foreigners and a series of engagements
followed in which Diaz was victorious.
The war was ended by the capture of the City
of Mexico after a siege of several assaults.</p>

<p>From boyhood until the close of the empire
in 1867, General Diaz had worked against great
odds. He was by this time easily the most
popular man in Mexico. One party at the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
elections of that year nominated him
for president, but he refused to run against
his old friend and patron, President Juarez. He
even refused an office and resigned his commission
in the army. In search of rest he retired
to the place of his birth, and his trip from the
capital was a triumphal journey. The citizens
of Oaxaca received him with open arms, and
presented him with the estate of La Noria near
that city. Hither he went with the wife whom
he had married by proxy during the war and
spent a few years in comparative quiet. In
1871 another presidential election was held.
Juarez, who had failed both mentally and physically,
had advocated a number of unpopular
measures, but was determined to have himself
reëlected to office. Diaz was also a candidate.
When Juarez was declared elected, the “Porfiristas”
declared a revolution with the slogan
“less government and more liberty.” However
Juarez died in a few months and the executive
power temporarily fell upon the president of
the Supreme Court, Lerdo de Tejada, who was
afterwards elected to that office to serve the unexpired
term.</p>

<p>General Diaz refused reconciliation with this
government, and, fearing trouble before the
next presidential election, for Lerdo was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
active candidate, he sold his estate and left for
the United States after a “<i>pronunciamento</i>,”
called the “Plan of Tuxtepec,” had been issued
to which he gave his allegiance, if he was not the
author of it. This “plan” declared a president
ineligible to succeed himself. By the time
the revolution was well underway in several
states, General Diaz had crossed the Rio Grande
at Brownsville, Texas, with forty followers.
These forty men increased to four hundred in
a few days and they captured Matamoros on
April 2nd, 1876.</p>

<p>Learning that a large force had been sent
after him, General Diaz decided to return south.
He went to New Orleans and took a steamer
from there, called the City of Habana, sailing
for Vera Cruz, and passed himself off as a
Cuban doctor. He was not suspected until some
of the troops he had captured at Matamoros a
few weeks before got on board the ship at Tampico.
They immediately made arrangements to
secure him on arriving at Vera Cruz. Although
the ship was four miles from land, Diaz jumped
overboard and attempted to swim ashore. He
was picked up after nightfall in an exhausted
condition, and taken on board the ship again.
However the purser was won to his cause and
concealed him in a wardrobe, where he remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
for several days on a diet of ship’s biscuit and
water. The purser, as a matter of policy and
in order to disarm all suspicion, invited the
Lerdist officers into his cabin, where they
would spend hours in playing at cards. Oftentimes
the chair of the one sitting in front of
the wardrobe would be tilted back against the
door behind which was the man they would have
given almost anything to catch. From his
cramped position General Diaz was in torment.
He could not stand upright, nor was he able to
sit down. When the <i>City of Habana</i> arrived
at Vera Cruz the chief of the coast guard service,
who was the fugitive’s friend, managed to
smuggle in to him a dilapidated sailor’s suit
and a very old pair of boots. At the same time
the chief sent word that a rowboat, in charge
of a man he would recognize by certain signals,
would come alongside for him. When the ship
began to unload bales of cotton into barges,
this boat appeared among them, and the noted
prisoner made his escape to land.</p>

<p>After several exciting adventures on the way,
General Diaz again appeared at Oaxaca among
his friends and ardent supporters. His popularity
and prestige in Oaxaca have always been
remarkable. Never did he appeal to his neighbours
and friends of that state in vain. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
not long until he was at the head of an army
of four thousand “Porfiristas”—men who
would follow their leader to the death if need
be, and many of whom had fought with him at
Puebla and elsewhere. The news of the escape
of Diaz brought gloom to the “Lerdistas.”
Lerdo immediately marched his army southward.
The two armies met on the 16th of November,
1876, at Tecoac, and for a few hours
the battle waged hotly and bitterly. The Lerdist
army, which was considerably larger, began
the engagement with every prospect of
success. At the last moment Diaz led a charge
in person which routed the enemy, and the
result was a complete triumph for the “Porfiristas.”</p>

<p>Flushed with victory, and determined to
press his advantage to the utmost, General
Diaz promptly proceeded toward the capital
with his augmented army. Panic seized Lerdo
and his followers. He took all the public funds
available, and, with his ministers, fled to Acapulco.
Upon arriving there he embarked for
San Francisco, and made no further effort to
impede the progress of the Diaz forces. Iglesias,
President of the Supreme Court, upon
whom the succession legally fell upon the death
or resignation of the President, established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
headquarters at Guanajuato and issued a proclamation
assuming the office of chief executive.
Diaz at once marched upon Puebla, which he
entered without opposition. City after city
sent representatives announcing their adherence
to his cause. The onward march was continued
without a halt until Guadalupe, about
three miles from the capital, was reached.
Here he halted for a day in order to get his
forces into presentable condition to make a
triumphal entry into the historic capital.</p>

<p>It was on the 24th of November, 1876, that
General Diaz made his memorable march into
the City of Mexico. Riding at the head of an
army of several thousand armed men he made
a triumphal entry into that ancient capital,
while thousands gathered along the route to
see this new adventurer—as he was styled by
his enemies. The Plaza was packed with the
populace. This son of an innkeeper, this man
with the blood of the Indian in his veins, this
hero of many battles passed through the portal
of the National Palace and became master
of Mexico. From there he issued a proclamation
assuming the provisional presidency of
the republic, until an election could take place
in regular form and a constitutional ruler
should be chosen. This was held in December.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
With the government in his hands the result
of that election was never in doubt. After a
three months’ campaign his authority was recognized
over the entire republic. Since that
time Porfirio Diaz occupied that high office continuously,
except for an interval of four years
from 1880 to 1884, when Manuel Gonzalez held
that title, until May 25th, 1911, when he resigned.
Diaz himself became a victim of the
“Tuxtepec Plan,” forbidding two consecutive
terms, and gracefully retired at the end of his
first term, although urged by a large following
to remain at the head of the government. For
the first time in Mexican history was seen the
spectacle of one President voluntarily relinquishing
the sceptre to his successor, and returning
to private life without an effort to
retain himself in power. Gonzalez entered the
office one of the most popular men in Mexico,
having been elected by an almost unanimous
vote. Four years later he left it under a cloud
of almost universal execration and contempt.
During the four years of Gonzalez’s administration
Diaz was not idle, but served in the
cabinet, as governor of Oaxaca and senator
from Morelas. Isolated disturbances have
arisen at times, but no formidable opposition
arose against him until 1910. This revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
is treated in the succeeding chapter. The law
limiting the succession was revoked during his
second term, and the length of office was subsequently
extended to six years. At the various
elections the reported vote was almost
unanimous for Diaz. On December 1st, 1910,
he was inaugurated President for the seventh
consecutive term, or eighth term in all.</p>

<p>Immediately upon first assuming the executive
office after the flight of Lerdo, Diaz issued
a statement in which he set forth in clear terms
his intention to restore constitutional order
and institute reforms. He invited all factions
and cliques to coöperate with him. This soon
won the regard of the intelligent and honest
partisans of all factions, and he early showed
his impartiality by selecting his advisers irrespective
of party. It was not long until most
of the Lerdistas and Juaristas were won to his
cause. By this skilful handling of the leaders,
he secured the good will of Congress in furthering
his plans for reforms, and in organizing
the finances on a better basis. New treaties
were negotiated with foreign nations and
able diplomatic representatives sent abroad.</p>

<p>It has been said that the best peacemakers
are those who have made war. Those who
detest powder most are generally those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
have smelled it on the field of battle. To them—more
than all others—are known the horrors
and hardships of war, and what it entails
upon the innocent and guilty alike. Even
though a battle-scared hero may have profited
by the advantages gained by military success,
the tragedy of empty homes and nameless
graves is known to and acknowledged by him.
General Sherman said: “The main thing is
to deal as hard blows at the enemy’s forces as
possible, and then cause so much suffering to
the inhabitants that they will long for peace.”
A similar belief animated President Diaz. He
himself has said in explaining his actions in
suppressing brigandage: “Sometimes we were
harsh to the point of cruelty. But it was all
necessary to the life and progress of the nation.
If there was cruelty, the results have justified
it. It was better that a little blood be shed
that much blood be saved. The blood that was
shed was bad blood; the blood that was saved
was good blood.” Almost before they knew
what was happening the professional malcontents
found themselves in the grip of this masterful
new leader. It was to this quality of
firmness that he owed his pronounced success
during the first years of his presidency.</p>

<p>Several scattered uprisings occurred during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
the first term, most of them being fostered by
the “Lerdistas.” Lerdo issued a proclamation
on the 24th of February, 1877, from New
York, claiming to be the constitutional President,
and, a few months later, Iglesias did the
same thing from New Orleans. Neither of
these manifestos were looked upon seriously
by the Mexicans, but they were in a great
measure responsible for the tardy recognition
of the Diaz government by the United States
and other foreign powers. One revolt is
worthy of mention because of its novelty. A
part of the crew of the armed vessel <i>Trinidad</i>
mutinied during the absence of the commander
at Vera Cruz. They headed for a Campeche
port, where they seized several thousand dollars
of public funds. While the leaders of the
mutiny were ashore enjoying the money, a
counter mutiny was led by the boatswain, who
took the ship back to Vera Cruz and returned
it to the government.</p>

<p>Judging this man at a distance, we, who live
in a country where even a third term is a
“bogie,” are inclined to smile at these successive
elections to the presidency, and dismiss
the matter with the charge of “dictator” and
“republican despot,” with all the odium that
those terms imply. President Diaz was both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
But, above all, he was, I believe, a true patriot.
Whatever may have been his original motives
in seeking this high office his later actions
prove the statement. Responsibility will often
develop a man, and that may have been true
with Diaz. In securing the control by driving
out Lerdo, and assuming the provisional presidency
over Iglesias, who was the official designated
by the constitution in case of a vacancy,
he only did what many had done before.
Whether his retention of the office for so long
was a good or bad thing for the country, the
historian of the future will be a better judge.</p>

<p>The accomplishments of Diaz were many.
It would require a long enumeration to give
them in detail. The very fact that he succeeded
to a government which had seen fifty-four
different rulers, including two emperors
and a number of avowed dictators, in the fifty-five
years preceding his own accession, and
ruled the country for more than a generation,
is in itself sufficient to stamp him as an extraordinary
man. Those were indeed troublous
times in Mexico while we were celebrating
the centennial of our independence. The
strong spirit of Juarez had been broken by the
long strain from 1857 to 1872, during which
time he was nominally President. His successor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
was a weak, ambitious man who accomplished
little. Disorder everywhere, the country
overrun with bandits and a worse than
empty treasury were the conditions when Diaz
grasped the reins. It was not until nearly two
years afterward that his government was formally
recognized by the United States. Few
men could have steered the country through
such a state of affairs so successfully. He did
it without repudiating any valid claims. He
established credit by paying foreign obligations
rather than the salaries of government
employees. He surrounded himself with an
able cabinet, and started the machinery of government
in a business-like way.</p>

<p>I do not subscribe to the doctrine of Shakespeare
that all the world is a stage, and that
each person is a player, for that would take
away sincerity. Porfirio Diaz has been accused
of only acting a part. He could not
always be acting, for his course was too consistent
under many and diverse circumstances.
As a young man he refused pay for military
services because the government was so poor.
He declined promotion over the heads of men
older in the service for fear of jealousies. He
refused remuneration after the close of the war
of intervention, although not a rich man at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
time. He turned a deaf ear to the emissaries
of Maximilian, who wanted to place him in
command of the Mexican army when that ruler
abdicated, which would practically have made
him President. He was a humane adversary,
as is shown by his treatment of prisoners of
war. He disregarded ceremony as much as is
possible in a Latin country. He declined to
live in the National Palace, but resided in a
private house the most of the time, and at
Chapultepec a part of the year.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that the man who
rules with a strong arm will make bitter enemies
as well as warm partisans. Likewise such
a policy will always have its defamers as well
as its supporters. Opinion is still divided
upon Napoleon, and whether his high-handed
methods wrought more good than evil. Hence
it is that some can see nothing in Diaz but a
tyrant, an enslaver of his people, and a man
unfit for even life itself. They forget that
peonage was not originated by Diaz, but was
inherited from the Spaniards and supported
by the voters of the country. They do not look
into the conditions faced by Diaz when he first
became President, nor the bloody history of
the republic before that time. I believe that
Diaz would have been permitted to serve his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
term had it not been for his efforts to control
the vice-presidency, and the fact that his
choice fell upon a man who was very unpopular.
Knowing that at his age the President’s
span of life was uncertain, the politicians
wanted to control this office because of the
succession. For this reason discontent and
jealousies had been growing for several years.
Diaz had publicly declared his intention not to
seek another term, so that those ambitious for
that office took him at his word and began their
wire-pulling. This was in February, 1908.
Then, in the spring of 1910, he announced that
yielding to importunity he would accept another
term. This was the one great mistake
in his political career. Had Diaz adhered to
his previous declaration, he would have retired
from the office of chief executive full of honours.
As it is he resigned under pressure, and
left the City of Mexico unannounced and accompanied
only by his family and a few
friends. He boarded a steamer in the harbour
of Vera Cruz and sailed for Spain, where he
has quietly resided since that time.</p>

<p>The personality of this dictator-president,
who has filled such an important place in the
world’s history, is most interesting. As I sat
in the great salon of the National Palace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
awaiting the appearance of President Diaz, I
spent the intervening fifteen or twenty minutes
in examining the room. On the high walls
were pictures of General Washington, the
father of liberty in the whole of the two Americas;
of the patriot-priest Hidalgo, who first
raised the standard of revolt in Mexico, and of
Diaz himself. Then Diaz appeared—a man
tall for a Mexican, solidly built, with white
closely cropped hair and white moustache. He
approached with an elastic, graceful and
springy step entirely belying his almost eighty
years. The Indian blood could easily be traced
in his complexion and features. The most
striking feature of this man is his eyes, which
seem to look into the very soul of all he meets.
It is probably this intuitive perception that
has been one of the key-notes of his success.
He has always been a democratic sort of man
and easy of approach, and impresses his sincerity
on all those who talk with him. Diaz
was always a tireless worker and methodical
in his habits. He is abstemious, and it is probably
due to this characteristic and his methodical
habits, that at eighty years of age he remained
as active and energetic as the average
man twenty years younger. He kept in touch
with the most remote parts of the republic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
even to the most distant village. His advisers
were often surprised at the vast knowledge he
displayed in all matters of state. The private
life of Diaz has always been above reproach.
He has been twice married. His first wife was
Delfina Ortega y Reyes, who died in 1880 before
sharing in the full greatness of her husband,
leaving a son and two daughters, all of
whom are still living. Three years later he
was married to a daughter of Romero Rubio,
whose full name is Señora Doña Carmen Romero
Rubio de Diaz. She is a woman who by
her sweetness of character, kindly disposition
and charities won a warm place in the affections
of the Mexican people.</p>

<p>The end of the political career of Diaz is
not without a touch of pathos, as well as an
element of personal dignity. Broken in health,
and deserted by many of his former friends,
he resigned the office of President in the following
letter addressed to Congress:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Señores</span>: The Mexican people, who have
generously covered me with honours, who proclaimed
me as their leader during the international
war, who patriotically assisted me in all
works undertaken to develop industry and the
commerce of the republic, to establish its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
credit, gain for it the respect of the world and
obtain for it an honourable position in the concert
of the nations; that same people has revolted
in armed military bands, stating that
my presence in the exercise of the supreme
executive power was the cause of this insurrection.</p>

<p>“I do not know of any facts imputable to
me which could have caused this social phenomenon;
but acknowledging as possible,
though not admitting, that I may be unwittingly
culpable, such a possibility makes me
the least able to reason out and decide my own
culpability.</p>

<p>“Therefore, respecting, as I always have
respected, the will of the people and in accordance
with Article 82 of the Federal Constitution,
I come before the supreme representatives
of the nation in order to resign, unreservedly,
the office of Constitutional President
of the republic with which the national vote
honoured me, which I do with all the more
reason, since in order to continue in office it
would be necessary to shed Mexican blood, endangering
the credit of the country, dissipating
its wealth, exhausting its resources and
exposing its policy to international complications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope, señores, that, when the passions
which are inherent to all revolutions have been
calmed, a more conscientious and justified
study will bring out in the national mind a correct
acknowledgment, which will allow me to
die carrying engraved in my soul a just impression
of the estimation of my life, which
throughout I have devoted and will devote to
my countrymen.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE REVOLUTION OF 1910</span></h2>

<p>The year 1910 marked the completion of one
hundred years of Mexican independence. In
September of that year this event was celebrated
with all the pomp and pageantry customary
in Latin countries. Nearly the whole
month was given up to public functions in
various parts of the republic, and especially
in the City of Mexico, the national capital.
Representatives of all the great nations of the
world were sent there to assist in the ceremonies
incident to the celebration. Dedications
of public buildings, magnificent balls,
public fêtes and exercises commemorative of
independence and of the national heroes, who
led the struggle against the Spaniards, were
numerous. The 15th and the 16th of September
were the great gala days of this centennial
anniversary. The further fact that added lustre
to the event was the eightieth anniversary
of the birth of President Diaz, who had established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
a substantial government after the many
years of strife through which the country had
passed between the years 1810 and 1876. In
all the speeches made by foreign representatives
the great work of this man was extolled,
as well as the progress that had been made by
the nation itself.</p>

<p>The culmination of the centennial ceremonies
was on the night of the 15th, just a little while
before midnight. By half past ten o’clock the
immense Plaza, which faces the National Palace,
was filled with an immense crowd of Mexican
dignitaries, distinguished foreigners and
the population of the city. It was a mass of
living, breathing, expectant humanity. The
many coloured lights formed veritable rainbows
of colour, and this added an additional
attraction to the teeming, seething crowd. The
door leading to the central balcony on the front
of the National Palace opened, and President
Diaz appeared. An intense stillness fell upon
the crowd. In his right hand the President
carried the national flag of Mexico, and immediately
on his appearance the red, white and
green lamps (the national colours) surrounding
the old bell with which Hidalgo first
sounded the call to liberty, and which has
found a permanent resting place here, flashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
into a radiant glow. As the strains of the
national anthem floated out on the breeze, the
President waved his flag, rang the bell and
shouted “Viva Mexico!” The great crowd
went wild with excitement. The cry of “Viva
Mexico!” was taken up by the crowd near to
the President, and then by those farther away,
until the great shout might have been heard
all over the capital. The bells of the grand
old cathedral pealed forth their loudest tones,
the factory whistles shrieked, sky-rockets were
sent up in the air and every noise-making device
was turned loose. Pandemonium reigned.
“Viva Diaz!” and “Viva el Presidente!”
were mingled with the cry of “Viva Mexico!”</p>

<p>In the light of later events this wonderful
celebration seems to have been a sham, or at
least only on the surface. At that time a political
volcano was simmering all over the republic,
and was just ready to break forth into violent
eruption. Diaz had already been re-elected
for the eighth term, but the inauguration was
not to take place until the fifth of December.
In November the first outbreaks against the
civil authorities occurred. An abortive rising
occurred in Puebla in which blood was shed.
Armed bodies appeared in the states of Chihuahua
and Sonora, in the northwestern part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
of the republic. These bodies attacked the
outlying <i>haciendas</i>, robbed the owners of horses
and foraged at will to secure supplies for themselves
and their horses. The country in which
these outbreaks occurred is ideal for the guerilla
warfare that followed. Both of those
states are mountainous and thinly settled, so
that it was comparatively easy for even a small
band of armed men to make a great deal of
trouble and escape from a much larger force
that might attempt to pursue them.</p>

<p>Government troops were promptly dispatched
to the scene of trouble, but it was difficult to
catch up with the marauders and engage them
in battle. Their outbreaks would first be heard
of in one neighbourhood, and a few days later
reports of trouble would be received from sections
quite remote. Additional armed bodies
appeared in other sections, and it was not many
weeks until the trouble began to present a serious
aspect. Many of the government troops
sent against the insurrectos were either cowardly
or were in secret sympathy with those
opposed to the government. Whenever actual
engagements did occur the outcome was generally
in favour of the Federal troops, but the
defeated ones were always able to escape into
the country, where it was difficult for them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
be followed. The first battle of any note was
fought at Mal Paso, when the Federals were
routed, but a battle at Ojinaga a few days later
was a decided defeat for the revolutionists.
The failure of the government to stamp out
the trouble promptly gave encouragement to
all the disaffected ones, and the old spirit of
lawlessness that once prevailed seemed about
to break forth with all its animus and disregard
of the rights of private property.</p>

<p>The predominant figures among the insurrectos
were the Maderos, a wealthy family that
owned great estates near the city of Torreon.
In the presidential campaign that had just
passed, Francisco Madero had been a candidate
for the presidency. He was thrown into
prison, as that family asserted, simply because
he dared to oppose the dictator who had held
power for so long. The reason given out by
the government was, of course, far different.
Nevertheless all the disaffected factions of the
republic rallied around this family, which did
the principal financing of the revolutionists.
A propaganda was conducted in the United
States by the Maderos, and they obtained a
great deal of encouragement from the majority
of the newspapers of the United States, which
had recently taken a position extremely antagonistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
to the Diaz government. Francisco
Madero established a revolutionary junta in
El Paso, and large quantities of ammunition
were sent across the border. A warrant for
his arrest having been issued because of violation
of the neutrality laws, Madero with a
handful of followers crossed into Chihuahua
and entered actively into the campaign.</p>

<p>“No re-election” and “effective suffrage”
were the two catch-words of Madero. It was
very similar to that of Porfirio Diaz when he
swept everything before him. At no time were
there, according to the best reports that can be
obtained, more than a few thousand men enrolled
under the Madero banner. These troops
were scattered throughout northern Mexico,
from Ciudad Juarez to the Pacific Ocean.
Into their ranks were drawn many soldiers of
fortune from the United States, as well as from
Europe. A part of these men were no doubt
really patriotic in their motives, while others
simply grasped the chance of engaging in an
exciting campaign because of the freedom of
action which was offered, and also partly because
of the rewards that were promised by
those at the head of the revolution. An eye-witness
of the engagement at Tia Juana says
that not over ten per cent. of the insurrectos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
who captured that town were Mexicans, the
remainder being made up of Americans, including
some negroes, Germans, English and
other nationalities. This engagement occurred
on May 8th and 9th, 1911. The Federals threw
up breastworks of bags of sand, and the women
and children were sent out of town to the
American side. The fighting was severe and
many were killed on both sides. On the second
day the government forces yielded, and the
rebels immediately pillaged the town and
stores.</p>

<p>Most of the engagements took place at towns
near the border, at Ciudad Juarez, Nogales
and Douglass, as well as Tia Juana. Two
reasons were probably responsible for this fact.
One was that it gave the insurrectos, in case
they were defeated, an easy escape across the
border, and another was that they were anxious
to capture the custom-houses in order to
secure the revenue from that source. This
would also enable them to set up a <i>de facto</i>
government, which might secure for them recognition
from countries that looked upon them
with favour. Because of these fights on the
border, and the reckless shooting by the combatants,
no fewer than twenty citizens of the
United States were killed and twice that number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
wounded upon the American side, including
men, women and children, none of whom had
taken any part in the conflict. The camps of
the Maderistas at all times contained numerous
American correspondents, and the reports
of the majority of them were favourable to the
cause of that faction. The battle of Casas
Grandes was all but decisive. In this engagement
Madero took part and was slightly
wounded, while the opposing leader lost an
arm. But Madero was soon in the field again
at the head of his forces. The movement had
likewise spread, and the government faced
trouble in the country even as far south as the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec.</p>

<p>The aim of the Maderistas was to secure recognition
as belligerents from the government
of the United States, and it was also the desire
of the government to put down the insurrection
in order to prevent action by the United States
to suppress the trouble because of the complaint
of many Americans whose property had
been destroyed, or was in danger of destruction.
Railroad tracks were torn up, mines
were tampered with and much other interference
with the property of foreigners followed.
European governments did not dare to interfere
because of the Monroe Doctrine, and pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
was brought upon the government at Washington
to restore order. On May 8th there was
great excitement in the United States following
orders issued by the Department of War
for the mobilization of American troops along
the Mexican border. Almost twenty thousand
troops were sent to Texas and centralized at
San Antonio. From there they were sent to
various places along the international border,
but with positive instruction to take no part
in the trouble on the other side of the Rio
Grande. The press looked upon this action as
preliminary to armed intervention, but no such
result followed. This movement of troops was
no doubt actuated by the motive of showing
what the United States could do, and of impressing
both sides to the conflict that foreign
property must be left undisturbed and the
rights of neutral parties carefully observed.</p>

<p>Several attempts were made by the Maderistas
to capture Ciudad Juarez, the prosperous
city directly opposite El Paso. The Federal
troops in the city were under the command
of General Navarro, while the insurrectos in
the final siege were commanded by Gen. Pascual
Orozco. After a battle of several days,
including considerable street fighting, General
Navarro surrendered his command of fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
hundred men to General Orozco on the 10th of
May. Shortly after this Madero himself entered
the city as victor, and immediately set up
a provisional government, giving himself the
title of Provisional President. This gave the
insurrectos control of the important custom
house at Ciudad Juarez, and was a great victory
for their cause. “On to Mexico” then
became the popular cry, and preparations began
to be made for that long march. Torreon
had fallen, and Pachuca, only forty miles from
the capital, had been taken possession of by
the revolutionists. Chihuahua and a number
of other cities were besieged by them.</p>

<p>At this stage Diaz and his advisers asked for
an armistice in order that negotiations might
be conducted. Each side appointed commissioners,
and efforts were made to agree upon
terms for settling the trouble into which the
country had been plunged. The Maderistas
refused to consider any terms which did not
involve the resignation of President Diaz,
Vice-President Corral and the entire cabinet.
President Diaz, in order to avoid further bloodshed,
the outcome of which would be very uncertain,
finally acceded to these terms and
agreed to resign before the end of the month.
His resignation was delayed, however, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
some time, and disorder again broke out in
several places. Even in the City of Mexico
mobs formed, and practically took possession
of the city on the 24th and 25th of May. Before
the close of the latter day President Diaz
handed in his resignation, as the Vice-President
had previously done, and the government
was turned over to Francisco de la Barra, who
had been agreed upon as the Provisional President
until a new executive could be chosen at
a special election. President Diaz secretly left
the City of Mexico, and embarked on a vessel
at Vera Cruz for Europe. A new cabinet was
selected by Acting-President Barra, the majority
of whom were suggested by Francisco Madero.
A wiser selection than Dr. de la Barra
it would have been difficult to make for such
a troublesome position. He had represented
Mexico at Washington just prior to the troubles
of his country, and commanded great respect
among the officials in that city.</p>

<p>With the downfall of Diaz the real troubles
of the Maderistas began. It is almost always
true that the victorious are impatient to secure
the fruits of their victory. Extravagant promises
had been made by the leaders of the revolution,
which included free land, lower taxes,
higher wages and a decreased cost of living.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
It was impossible for the leaders to do these
things at once, as it would take several years
to work out such a program. Although Francisco
Madero held no office, he had been designated
as an adviser of the new government,
and no appointments were made by the Provisional
President without his approval. This
brought about jealousies among the ambitious
leaders, and there has been more or less fighting
in various sections of the republic in
which much blood has been shed. A few generals
deserted the standards of Madero and
have kept up fighting on their own account. A
serious outbreak occurred in the city of Puebla
in which many were killed. Many political
parties followed, as it had been many years
since there was a definite party organization
in Mexico. Some of these were very small,
being made up simply of factional groups.
The Church party again became prominent and
started to take an active part in the approaching
election. Bernardo Reyes, who had been
sent on a mission to Europe by Diaz in order
to get him out of the country, returned, and
a strong party known as the Reyesistas arose
and wanted to nominate him for the presidency.
He left the country, however, before the final
elections, claiming to be in fear of his life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
This voluntary expatriation of General Reyes
on September 28th, when, disguised as an invalid,
he walked up the gang-plank of a steamer
at Vera Cruz, bound for New York, removed
the only obstacle in the path of Sr. Madero.
The election, which was held on Sunday, October
1st, 1911, was as peaceful as such an
event could be in most parts of Mexico. It
does not necessarily mean that they were not
inclined to fight, but there was nothing to fight
about. The result was that the electors chosen
were almost unanimous for Francisco Madero.</p>

<p>To an American this election would seem
almost farcical. For the purpose of the election
the country was divided into districts,
with one presidential elector for every five
hundred inhabitants. Before election day two
officials were appointed in each district. One
of these officials compiled a list of the voters
in his little subdivision. When he had looked
up the voters in his district, and the names
were printed and posted on some convenient
street corner, this official’s duties ended. Any
one whose name did not appear on the printed
list had a right to go to the proper authorities
and state his case. All those qualified to vote
received a ballot on which they were to write
the names of the electors they wished to vote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
for. The second official appointed took charge
of the election booth on the morning of the
election, and these booths were generally placed
at the entrance to business houses or even in
the parks. The voting places were supposed
to open at 9 o’clock. The first seven voters
who appeared, with the one commissioner appointed,
constituted the election board. In
American cities one could imagine a great rush
of voters to be among the first seven, but in
many of the Mexican booths that number did
not arrive until half an hour or an hour after
the time the booth was supposed to open. The
commissioner in charge sat at the table with
a list of the voters beside him, and, as the
voters appeared, they indicated the names of
the electors for whom they wished to vote, and
the commissioner then communicated this information
to the other members of the board in
an audible voice. As a general rule there was
no closed ballot box, but the ballots were merely
laid in an open pasteboard box with a paperweight
on top to hold them down. Of secrecy
or an attempt at secrecy there was none. Some
citizens sent their wives to vote for them with
the information that they themselves were indisposed,
and these ballots were accepted. It
is claimed that the peons generally abstained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
from voting, partly because of pride because
they were not able to write, but more likely
because of indifference since they had never
been allowed such a privilege before.</p>

</div>

<p>The only real contest in the election was over
the choice of a Vice-President. Dr. Vasquez
Gomez, who had been the principal aid of Sr.
Madero in the revolution, had been cast aside
by him in favour of José Maria Pino Suarez.
The cause of the disagreement between these
two leaders of the revolution was in part over
the name of the party. Dr. Gomez insisted
upon the original name of the revolutionist
party, which was Anti-reelectionista, while Sr.
Madero decided upon the name of Constitutional
Progressive. Dr. Gomez continued as a
candidate under the name chosen by him.
Many also voted for the Acting-President,
although he was not an active candidate. Other
names of parties with tickets in the field were
Pure Liberal Party, Red Liberals, Evolutionist
Party and Reyesistas. An active campaign
was carried on by several of the candidates,
and Señor Madero visited many of the states
in a speaking tour. Everywhere he was received
with respect and at many times with
real enthusiasm. Soldiers were present at the
voting booths in many places on election day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
to prevent trouble, but there was very little
disturbance in any part of the country.</p>

<p>On the 6th of November, 1911, Francisco
Indalecio Madero was inaugurated President of
Mexico with elaborate ceremonies, and Pino
Suarez was inducted into the office of Vice-President.
The new chief executive of the republic
was born on the Hacienda del Rosario,
in the state of Coahuila, on the 4th of October,
1873, and is still a young man. He is the eldest
of a family of thirteen children, and both of his
parents are members of wealthy land-owning
families. It is estimated that the revolution cost
the Maderos more than a million dollars, but
they could well afford it. He married Señorita
Sara Pérez, the daughter of a prominent Mexican,
in 1900. For several years President
Madero has been the leader of the opposition
in the republic. His appearance is not that of
a leader, for the new President is barely five
feet four in height and weighs less than one
hundred thirty-five pounds. His figure is
slight, with small hands and feet, and he wears
a full beard. By way of preparing for his
campaign Madero wrote a book entitled “The
Presidential Succession in 1910,” which created
such a tremendous sensation that it was finally
suppressed by the Diaz government. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
fearless arraignment of what he considered to
be the evils of that administration. On June
7th, 1910, he was arrested at Monterey and
imprisoned for several weeks, not being released
until after the election had been held.
It was then that he published his political platform
known as the “Plan of San Luis Potosi,”
which was issued from that city on the 5th of
October. Among the reforms advocated by
him were a more equitable distribution of the
lands of the republic, free restitution of lands
wrested from the Yaquis and a return of that
tribe to their native state, and an abolition of
the practice of admitting malefactors into the
national army.</p>

<p>It is impossible to predict the outcome of
the Madero administration. If the people
stand by him many needed reforms may be
accomplished. The main difficulty to be overcome
will be that personalism enters so much
into Mexican politics. If parties backed by
real and genuine principles and not dependent
for their strength upon a single personality,
shall arise, then peaceful conditions will return
and President Madero will be permitted to
work out his program. He showed himself
humane and considerate during the revolution,
although he did not distinguish himself especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
as a strategist or military leader. He
broke all precedents in yielding the provisional
presidency to Dr. de la Barra, instead of seizing
that office himself as he might easily have
done. In his speeches he has counselled moderation
among his followers. He has a difficult
task before him, but it is the hope of the writer
that he will not disappoint those who have
raised him to power.</p>

<p>President Madero has been accused of being
anti-American in his sympathies. As an answer
to this I quote from an authorized statement
by him in an American newspaper:</p>

<p>“I am glad at this time to have the opportunity
to assure the American people of my
great friendship and regard for them, and to
assure them that I will do all in my power
during my administration to strengthen still
more the already strong friendly relations existing
between the two nations. I feel very sure
that during my administration the bonds which
unite the sister republic will become far
stronger than they have ever been. I am a
great admirer of the American people, for I
went to school in the United States and I have
travelled much in your country. I will welcome
Americans to Mexico at all times. I want
to see American energy, American brains and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
American capital come to this country and
assist in its development and progress, and
Americans will always find a friend in me and
my government.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SIERRAS AND BEYOND</span></h2>

<p>“Las Madres,” says the Mexican, whenever
he is asked the name of the lofty range of
mountains that runs through the western part
of the northern half of Mexico, and which separate
the lofty interior plateaus from the Pacific
Ocean and the Gulf of California. This
range of mountains effectually cuts off the west
coast from the best developed part of Mexico,
and for that reason this section is not so well
known as those parts which are visited by travellers.
At the present time no railway has
been completed across this range of mountains,
but it will not be long until this disadvantage
will exist no longer. This district includes the
great states of Sonora and Sinaloa, the territory
of Tepic, and a large part of the states
of Chihuahua and Durango. To-day it is almost
a counterpart of what California was
before the gold rush of 1849—little known,
isolated and undeveloped—but with just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
great natural advantages. Dense jungles cover
the lower levels along the coast, where water
is plentiful, while great areas in the north are
semi-arid. In the higher altitudes vast forests
of pine and oak crown the serrated peaks.
The population is generally sparse and scattered.</p>

<p>In the future the main gateways to reach
this part of the country from the United States
will be El Paso, and Benson, Arizona. From
El Paso it is a distance of a little more than
two hundred miles to Chihuahua. The traveller
has no sooner crossed the Rio Grande than
the change is seen in the Mexican town of Ciudad
Juarez, formerly Paso del Norte. This
city was the objective point of the revolutionists
in the late trouble in that country, and was
the scene of a great deal of fighting before it
was finally captured. After its capture it was
the seat of the temporary government of the
Maderistas. For several hours on the journey
southward there is nothing to be seen but the
chaparral and desolate-looking hills, with just
enough novelty in the little towns that may be
passed to make the trip strange and rather
old-fashioned. Big-hatted, shiftless peons stare
at you from their leaning positions against the
station walls. The “hee-haw” of a lone burro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
or the “cough” of a gasoline engine will be
the only sounds to break the silence.</p>

<p>The train rolls along through a narrow valley
which is quite level, and with high tablelands
all about. Then the route reaches the
land of <i>haciendas</i>, where herds of cattle, sheep
and goats may be seen. It is a land of deep
valleys, with glimpses of majestic mountains,
and sometimes with broad spreading plains as
well, but the mountains are always in view. At
length, after a ride of a little more than half
a day, the train reaches Chihuahua, which is
the principal city and metropolis of this section
of Mexico. Chihuahua is not a very beautiful
city; nor is it as attractive as many of the
other Mexican cities, for its location and the
climate are not such as can greatly be recommended.
It is destined to be a much larger
city than at present, however, by reason of the
mineral wealth surrounding it, and also because
it is the starting point for what will ultimately
be the principal trade route between
the United States and northwestern Mexico.
Like Monterey this city has become very much
Americanized, and that influence is noticeable
in both people and architecture.</p>

<p>Chihuahua is on the line of the Kansas City,
Mexico and Orient Railway, which, when completed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
will form a direct route from Kansas
City, Missouri, to Topolobampo, a new port on
the Pacific. At the present time trains are running
from Wichita, Kansas, almost to the Mexican
border, and two detached sections are in
operation in the Republic of Mexico. One of
these starts from a point near the Rio Grande
and runs to Chihuahua. From Chihuahua
westward this railroad, in conjunction with the
Mexican Northwestern Railway, traverses one
of the finest grazing sections of the republic.
Broad prairies which are covered with grass
stretch out on either side to the foothills, and
form rich grazing lands. The vast ranges, the
temperate climate and a fair average rainfall
makes this almost an ideal country for cattle.
Upon them are fattened the beef that feeds the
country, and many animals find their way to
the markets of the United States. It is a region
of immense <i>haciendas</i>, which form almost empires
in themselves, for they are larger than
some of the principalities of Europe. One
estate near Chihuahua would make a commonwealth
as large as the states of Massachusetts
and Rhode Island combined, with a small farm
of a million acres besides. The Zuloaga family
own a <i>hacienda</i> directly on this line of railway,
which is thirty-five miles wide and nearly one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
hundred miles long, and includes about two
million acres. Most of this estate consists of
fine grazing land, and it ships about forty thousand
head of cattle each year, as well as from
three to six thousand mules and horses. A
few years ago the late proprietor of this estate
bought an adjoining farm for two hundred
thousand dollars, and his method of paying for
it is a good illustration of Mexican business
methods. He secured silver coin for this
amount, which weighed nearly six tons, and
hauled it over to the seller in two great carts.</p>

<p class="caption">A GROUP OF PEONS</p>
</div>

<p>The buildings of the Zuloaga <i>hacienda</i>, which
I visited, lie about fifty miles west of Chihuahua,
in one of the most beautiful locations that
could be found anywhere. They are near the
foot of a range of low mountains, and in front
projects out a plain that gently slopes down
to a lake a couple of miles distant. Beyond
the lake is another range of wooded hills which
seem to complete the picture. Within the walls
are the home of the <i>hacendado</i>, the church, the
stables and a store. The church is a beautiful
structure, artistic in its details, and all of the
materials used in its construction were secured
upon the plantation; and all of the work, including
some magnificently carved woodwork
and some creditable paintings, was done on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
premises and by those living there. The buildings
are all one-storied in height, with walls
thick enough to withstand any earthquake.
The rooms are large and airy, with extremely
high ceilings, through which you might drive
a carriage, and the parlours are nearly as large
as public halls. More than three thousand
peons are employed on this <i>hacienda</i>, most of
whom live in buildings arranged in big hollow
squares just outside of the walls of the family’s
quarters.</p>

<p class="caption">TARAHUMARI INDIANS.</p>
</div>

<p>There are a number of small towns along
this trans-continental line of railway, the principal
of which is Miñaca, a quaint little old-fashioned
place. The inhabitants would rather
attend a chicken fight than work or go to mass.
From Miñaca this road begins the real climb
over the divide on its way to the Pacific coast.
For scenic beauty it equals any railroad in
Mexico, not excepting the ride over the Mexican
railway from the City of Mexico to Vera
Cruz, hitherto described. Deep cuts, high
hills, and tunnels succeed each other, as the
railroad climbs up on its way toward the line
of perpetual snow. It passes through one of
the best timber sections of Mexico, where tall
pine trees, straight as an arrow, rise up for
a hundred feet or more without a limb. Huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
crags of fantastic outline, tall pines silhouetted
against the low-hanging clouds and the mysterious
depths of the barrancas combine to
form scenes of awe-inspiring grandeur. At
dangerous points crosses on the trail tell the
story of tragedies—of riders who have probably
stumbled into eternity without a moment’s
warning.</p>

<p>This Sierra region of Mexico should appeal
to the sportsman, for much game abounds. At
nearly all elevations may be found the white-tail
deer. The mountain lion, called <i>tigre</i>,
lurks in the fastnesses of the mountains. The
bear may be found wherever there are good
feeding grounds. The wild turkey is plentiful
in many sections. The Mexicans do not hunt
much, so that there are many game birds.
Quail are numerous in the foothills, and wild
duck, snipe and curlew are exceedingly numerous
on the lagunas and marshes of the coast,
as well as in the lakes of the mountain region.
Hunting is inexpensive, and it is strange that
more Americans do not visit this unhunted region.</p>

<p>One of the strangest of the many tribes of
Mexican Indians inhabit the valleys and barrancas
of this part of the republic. These are
the Tarahumaris, a timid race who rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
shrink from contact with the white people to
any greater extent than is necessary. Occasionally
these Indians may be seen on the
streets of Chihuahua, whither they go to buy
some things, or, perhaps, to carry a message
for a Mexican or American. But they do not
linger any longer than is necessary. They can
always be distinguished from the other Indians
because the men almost invariably have their
legs absolutely bare in all kinds of weather.
They also wear their hair long, and it hangs
down over the shoulder like our red men, while
the Mexican Indians usually wear their hair
short. Their features are coarse, but their
bearing has a kind of native dignity about it
that attracts. One of their medicine men once
cut his hair to get some new ideas. While the
new hair was growing he kept his head tied
up to prevent his thoughts from escaping. I
mention this to give an idea of the primitiveness
and simplicity of these strange people.</p>

<p>The Tarahumaris pay no taxes or tribute to
the Mexican government. They are quiet and
inoffensive, however, and for that reason they
are allowed to inhabit the mountain slopes and
inhospitable barrancas in peace. Their houses
are very simple. They are usually made by
setting up forked poles across which other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
straight poles are laid, and then roughly-hewed
boards are set up along the sides. Sometimes
they are made entirely of small rocks. Many
of them live in the natural caves which abound
in that region, and of which I have seen scores.
They are nomadic and change their domicile
frequently, although the new location may be
only a few hundred rods away from the old.
Store-houses may be seen in which the family
stores its surplus supply of corn and beans,
which are the only food supplies cultivated by
these people. Upon the mountains the men kill
deer and squirrels, and these, together with fish,
rats and little ground animals which abound in
that region, constitute their principal meat
supply.</p>

<p>The Tarahumaris are not a sociable people,
nor are they industrious, for they like too well
to lie on their backs or breasts in the hot sun.
They are great runners and have been known
to run day after day, stopping only to eat and
secure some necessary sleep. When they are
travelling across the country one will seldom
see them walking. Even on a mountain trail
they usually keep up a trot. I have seen them
running up a steep path where most of us would
not want to walk very long without stopping
to rest. The chief men of the tribes carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
canes as their emblem of authority. If a man
is charged with an offence a messenger is sent
to him, armed with a cane made of red Brazil
wood, and the person summoned would not
dare to disobey the order. No writ issued by
any court in a civilized land commands greater
obedience. It is generally the older men who
are entrusted with this badge of authority, and
they are very jealous of the privilege. This
method of designating authority is quite common
among the aborigines of the Americas.
The Tarahumaris are very superstitious. They
are afraid to travel after night because the
dead are supposed to be abroad at that time.
The <i>shaman</i>, as the medicine man is called, is
a man of great importance among these superstitious
people. He is always present at all
family celebrations, such as weddings and funerals,
and he is generally called in when there
is sickness in the family.</p>

<p>About one hundred and fifty miles southwest
of El Paso, in the state of Chihuahua, is a colony
of considerable interest to Americans.
After travelling that number of miles of semi-desert
land over the Rio Grande and Sierra
Madre Railway from Ciudad Juarez, as dreary
a landscape as one could imagine, the appearance
suddenly changes as one approaches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
lands of the Mormon colony that has settled
here. Fearful of the results of the anti-polygamy
agitation in the United States a few hundred
followers of Brigham Young banded together,
and sought a new “promised land.”
They travelled in caravans that contained all
their worldly goods until they crossed the border
into Mexico. Here they were welcomed,
for farmers are what northern Mexico needed,
and religious or ethical questions did not disturb
the Mexican government. The colonists
were exempted from taxes for ten years, and
their implements were allowed free entry.
Each colonist was granted a certain number of
acres at low interest and on easy terms.</p>

<p>The original colony has expanded into several
settlements numbering more than five thousand
persons. The principal colony is named
Colonia Juarez, and it is a few miles from the
station of Casas Grandes. The Mormons are
splendid agriculturalists, and they sell large
quantities of alfalfa, grains, potatoes and dairy
products. They use the very latest of American
agricultural machinery on their farms.
Every village has a graded school supported
by a voluntary tax, and a large central academy
is also maintained for higher education. They
are devout followers of the Mormon prophets,—these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
colonists across the Rio Grande,—although
they claim that no open polygamy is
practised. Each man will deny the possession
of more than one wife. The excess of women
with families over the men, however, and the
fact that the Mormon man is thoroughly at
home in more than one house would easily lead
one to a different conclusion. To this must be
added the knowledge that these Mormons left
good homes in Utah for a tract of almost desert
land in Mexico, mainly because of the efforts
of the government of the United States to
stamp out plural marriages.</p>

<p>The other main route to the Sierra regions
is an extension of the Southern Pacific Railroad,
which is known as the Sonora Railway.
This railroad extends from Nogales, and it is
destined to run to the city of Guadalajara, a
distance of about eleven hundred miles. Nogales
is a city of about three thousand inhabitants,
half of which lies on either side of the
border line. A simple glance without any explanation
would show the visitor which part of
it belongs to the United States, because of the
difference in the buildings and the energy of
the inhabitants. From there the railroad runs
south through Magdalena and across some fertile
plains until, at a distance of almost three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
hundred miles from the border, it reaches Hermosillo,
the capital of the state of Sonora,
which is the second largest state in the republic.
Much of this state is useless for agriculture, as
it is dry and arid, and a part is very mountainous.
In other sections the soil is extremely
fertile, and irrigation would render it invaluable.
Such projects could be carried out if
there was as much enterprise on that side of
the border as on the northern side. Near the
Yaqui River the soil and climate are as well
adapted to fruit culture as southern California.
There are many large mining enterprises,
the largest being at Cananea, and nearly all
are American enterprises. The trouble with
the Yaqui Indians has greatly hindered development
in Sonora during the past decade. Several
parties of American prospectors and miners
were attacked and a number of Americans
killed. The government finally deported thousands
of the Yaquis to other sections of the
republic, and their depredations then ceased.</p>

<p>Hermosillo is situated on the Sonora River,
in the midst of an agricultural district and surrounded
by rugged mountains, where there are
many mines of gold and silver. It is the seat
of a Catholic diocese, for which a fine new
cathedral has been built, and also has some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
very creditable buildings. It is a city of perhaps
ten or twelve thousand people, and is the
largest city in the state. From Hermosillo this
railroad runs to the port of Guaymas, which
is quite an important commercial town, and less
than a hundred miles from the capital. The
Bay of Guaymas is one of the best on the Pacific
coast, and the marine trade is quite important.
For a long time this town was the
terminus of this railroad, but it is too far up
the Gulf of California to ever become a very
important ocean port. Within the last few
years construction work has been rapidly
pushed southward at a little distance from the
coast, and through trains are now running as
far as the city of Tepic, on the way to Guadalajara.</p>

<p>Not a great distance south of Guaymas the
Sonora Railroad enters Sinaloa, a state nearly
as large as Indiana. This state is destined to
be a great agricultural state, as it is well watered
and contains a number of fine rivers.
Besides the Fuerte, Sinaloa, Culiacan and
Elota Rivers, there are a hundred or more
smaller streams traversing it. It stretches
along the Pacific coast for a distance of nearly
four hundred miles, and has an average
breadth of eighty miles. One-half of the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
is little known, and is traversed only by obscure
and difficult trails. Cane and corn culture
have been the chief industry, but it offers
good inducements for the raising of almost all
kinds of grains. In undeveloped natural
wealth, both agricultural and mineral, and in
its splendid water powers, Sinaloa is unsurpassed
by any Mexican commonwealth. An
American land company has recently opened
up a tract of two million acres, and is establishing
a colony that promises good results.
The capital is Culiacan, a short distance from
the coast. Heretofore the only outlet for this
city of fifteen thousand has been a miserable
railroad to its port, Altata, but the new line
enables passengers to go by Pullman cars to
all points in the United States. It is an old
city, for the Spaniards found a considerable
settlement there. They immediately established
a town which was well fortified. The
present city is quite attractive and possesses
a little manufacturing. It is the residence seat
of quite a colony of rich and cultured Mexicans,
and a number of Americans interested in
mining also reside there.</p>

<p>Mazatlan, a little further down the coast, is
the largest city and principal port of Sinaloa.
It is a picturesque place, with its cathedral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
spires outlined against the sky, and cocoanut
palms and thatched roofs below. The blue
Cordilleras in the distance complete the picture.
A lighthouse at the north entrance is
said to be the highest lighthouse in the world,
with the exception of the one at Gibraltar. It
is a city of about twenty thousand inhabitants,
and the largest city on the Pacific coast. Although
a great deal of shipping is done in
Mazatlan, the harbour is poor and offers no
protection to vessels. Plans have been approved
for a safe harbour, to cost several million
pesos, in order to prepare it for the anticipated
increase in business. Whether the internal
troubles will stop the building of this
much-needed west coast railroad improvement
remains to be seen. Its completion will not
only give an outlet for this rich region to the
United States, but also to the City of Mexico,
and the stimulus can already be seen wherever
the railroad is in operation. There is not a
richer section in the whole republic than these
coast lands, but because of their isolation everything
has been backward, and all work has
been done in the very crudest and most primitive
ways. The only development that has
taken place is in mining, and most of the
mines are even yet operated in the old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
ways, because of the difficulty of transporting
machinery and fuel.</p>

<p>The territory of Tepic is almost as large as
the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut
combined. In natural resources it will compare
with Sinaloa, for it is well watered and
affords fine opportunities for agriculture.
Some day the jungles will be transformed into
orange groves and banana plantations, while
the higher lands will produce rich harvests of
grain and coffee. The water power could be
utilized to turn the wheels of factories or to
run the railroads which are so much needed.</p>

<p>The capital city of Tepic, a municipality of
fifteen thousand people, has been asleep, but
will now be awakened daily by the noise of the
locomotive. At an elevation of three thousand
feet the air is fresh and invigorating. The
climate is pronounced almost ideal by those
who live there, and it is free from the fevers
that prevail in the low coast lands. It does
not differ in general appearance from many
other Mexican cities, but is a quaint and interesting
town.</p>

<p>Separated from the mainland of Mexico by
the Gulf of California and the Colorado River,
lies that little known territory of Baja (lower)
California. It is a long narrow peninsula that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
projects about eight hundred miles southeasterly
from the southern border of California.
Its width varies from about thirty to over one
hundred miles, with an irregular coast line
over two thousand miles long bordered by numerous
islands, and in size is a trifle larger
than the state of Iowa. Lower California is
mainly mountainous, with irregular plains
along the Pacific coast, and smaller plains and
valleys along the north coast and in some parts
of the interior. In climatic and other physical
features the northern part of the peninsula is
very similar to southern California, with some
local modifications. The southern end of the
Colorado Desert crosses the border, and continues
down along the northern coast for some
distance. Along the Pacific coast a low range
of mountains recedes a short distance inland,
and continues for some distance. In the southern
part of the peninsula they become higher,
forming the San Pedro Martir Mountains,
which reach a height of over ten thousand feet
above the sea. Vast desolate plateaus of black
lava, which surround little gem-like valleys,
are succeeded by extensive stretches of desert
upon which nothing but the cactus will grow.
The western coast is bathed by cool waters
and fogs, while the eastern shores are washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
by the waves of a warm inland sea, and have
almost continuous sunshine.</p>

<p>Lower California was one of the early discoveries
of the Spaniards, and was promptly
placed in charge of the Jesuits, whose missionaries
were quite successful. They explored all
parts of the peninsula and established missions
among the Indians, and at the same time
introduced many of the crops and fruits of the
Old World. They established three main trails
throughout the length of the peninsula, one
following each coast and the other running
near the centre. These roads are to-day the
only routes of travel, and, except for short
distances, can only be pursued on mule-back.
Most of the Indians who formerly inhabited
the peninsula have disappeared, and the population
to-day is very small. Some of the old
mission churches are still in use, while others
are represented simply by fragments of ruined
walls and choked-up irrigating ditches.</p>

<p>Agriculture has never flourished to any great
extent in Lower California. Numerous colonies
have been practically failures, with the
exception of some recent ones near the international
border, where water for irrigation has
been obtained from the Colorado River. All
of the peninsula has been traversed many times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
by prospectors in search of gold, silver and
other minerals, and a number of valuable
mines have been located in various places.
The general climate is hot and arid, as is evidenced
by the vegetation, although in the southern
regions there are districts which have
regular summer rains. As a consequence of
the arid conditions the surface water is scarce,
and is limited to isolated waterfalls or to
springs from which small streams sometime
flow for a short distance, and then sink into
the earth.</p>

<p>The country is divided for administration
into the northern and southern portions, with
Ensenada, a small port on the west coast as
the capital of the northern part, and La Paz,
on the eastern coast, the capital of the southern
portion. La Paz is the only city of any particular
size, and is a place of about six thousand
people. The streets are well laid out,
and there are some excellent stores and many
comfortable houses. The gardens are filled
with palms and various tropical trees, so that
the city has quite a decided tropical appearance,
although it is surrounded by an arid district.
It is the seat of the pearl fisheries, which
are quite flourishing in the Gulf, and the output
of pearls is quite an important item. Tia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
Juana (Aunt Jane) is a small town on the
border not far from San Diego, and it is, perhaps,
better known than any other town on the
peninsula. Several skirmishes took place
within its borders during the recent revolution
led by Madero, and many of the participants
were Americans.</p>

<p>Magdalena Bay, concerning which there has
been considerable talk of the United States
trying to secure as a coaling station, is the
finest land-locked harbour on the Pacific coast,
with a narrow entrance which is protected by
the high headlands. The bay is about fifteen
miles across, with low sandy shores, and would
furnish a fine protection for scores of the
largest vessels. It is also within sight of the
regular sailing route of steamers bound for
Panama. For that reason it would be a very
advantageous possession of the United States,
if it could be obtained by negotiations with the
Mexican government.</p>

<p>The plant life of Lower California is different
from that of any other part of the world—so
naturalists say. There is a veritable riot
of strange forms of cacti and other plants
which manage to live without rainfall. The
cacti vary from giant forms, which raise their
massive fluted trunks to a height of fifty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
sixty feet, to little straggling species which are
too weak to stand upright. Another peculiar
form is the creeping devil cactus, as it is called,
which has the appearance of gigantic caterpillars
crawling in every direction. These plants
do actually travel away from a common centre,
as the stem sends down rootlets every little
distance, and then the older stems in the rear
die about as fast as it advances in the front.
There are not many species of birds or animals,
and only such kinds as can live where
water is scarce will be found. It is said that
some animals have been found that never drink
water, and even in captivity can not be taught
to drink, as it does not seem necessary to their
existence.</p>

<p>Owing to its desert character the peninsula
is very thinly peopled, and there are extensive
sections where not a single inhabitant will be
found. The most populous section is that
south of La Paz, where the rains are more
regular. A few small towns or villages will be
found scattered around the coast, with a limited
number of prospectors and miners gathered
in the interior. The effort to colonize
Lower California has been a tale of unbroken
failure for more than fifty years. A few rainy
years will cause apparent prosperity, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
succeeding years may be rainless and disaster
follows. Those who have studied Lower California
say that it is not all a hopeless desert,
but that there are possibilities of agriculture
through irrigation in many parts.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RUINED CITIES OF YUCATAN</span></h2>

<p>The Mayas (pronounced My-yah) were an
ancient people of whom little is known. They
dwelt on the broad plains of Yucatan and Central
America, and built many cities, or governmental
centres, for no ruins of private dwellings
have yet been found. The groups of
buildings resemble in no way our cities of the
present day. They consist everywhere of
temples and palaces of the reigning princes
or caciques, of public buildings scattered about
apparently at random, covering a vast area,
with cemented roads and gardens intervening.
The centres of the towns were occupied by the
public squares and temples; around these were
the palaces of the priests and lords, and the
outskirts were evidently allotted to the lower
classes. Religion and government seem to
have gone hand in hand among these primitive
Mexicans. The Maya civilization had
reached a height unexcelled by any people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
the western hemisphere prior to the coming of
the white man. They were skilled in architecture,
in sculpture and in writing. The priests
had developed the science of astronomy to a
considerable extent. They had studied with
some success the solar system. They had developed
a calendar system and created a chronology.
So far as these chronological accounts
have been worked out they run back
three thousand years or more. They reckoned
time much as we do, from a fixed date, namely,
the birth of Christ. The later dates of the
Quirigua inscriptions are generally believed to
be somewhere about the beginning of the Christian
era.</p>

<p>The oldest of the ruins of the Maya race is
said to be that of Copan, which is situated in
Honduras, just across the border from Guatemala.
It also seems to have been the southernmost
point of their migration, as Tula was the
northerly terminus of their wanderings. Then
comes Quirigua, in Guatemala, which is one
of the most remarkable and inexplicable of all
the ruins. Tradition sheds no light whatever
on these ruins of Copan or Quirigua. The
mysterious silence that surrounds these forms
a void in the history of the human race. There
are doubtless other ruins awaiting the traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
and explorer in the wilderness around
Lake Peten, in the northern part of Guatemala.
The founder of the race was Izamat-Ul. “To
him were brought,” says an old writer, “the
sick, the halt and the dead, and he healed and
restored them all to life by the touch of his
hand.” Hence he was generally known as the
Miraculous Hand, and in inscriptions is frequently
represented by a hand only.</p>

<p class="caption">CRUMBLING RUINS OF THE ANCIENT MEXICAN CIVILIZATION</p>
</div>

<p>In the extreme southeastern part of Mexico,
on a small peninsula known as Yucatan, is a
section which was at one time the abode of this
progressive and migrating race known generally
among anthropologists as the Mayas.
This distant province deserves far more mention
than it usually receives from passing travellers.
Though possessing few natural attractions
Yucatan is a never-ending source of
interest for the anthropologist and archeologist.
The whole peninsula is a vast limestone
formation, with little or no surface water.
Rain is infrequent in most parts, and one might
travel for miles without crossing a river or
brook, or even chancing upon a spring. In
most sections of this peninsula the water is
at least seventy feet below the surface of the
ground. At the present time windmills aid
the inhabitants of that section where the henequen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
from which binder twine is made, is
raised, but centuries ago such facilities were
unknown. There were, however, in some places
natural wells which reached down to the depth
of what seem to be underground rivers, and
it was near these that several ancient cities
were located. At least a score of these ancient
cities have been explored, of which the best
known and most important are Palenque, Uxmal
and Chichen Itza. It is known that since
the Spaniards first set foot on this peninsula
many monuments and practically entire cities
have disappeared. At one time, a contemporary
writer asserts, there were destroyed in
Yucatan five thousand idols of various forms
and dimensions, thirteen huge stones which
were used as altars, twenty-two smaller stones
of various shapes, one hundred and ninety-seven
manuscripts of all kinds, including
twenty-seven written on deer skins.</p>

<p>Chichen Itza, which is generally interpreted
to mean “the mouth of the wells of the Itzas,”
seems to have been the leading city, and it was
located near two of the largest natural wells,
which are immense natural pits with perpendicular
sides. It is probable that these phenomena
attracted the Mayas in their northern
migration. As the tribes quarrelled different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
factions separated from the original body and
established new cities as capitals. Thus Chichen
Itza came into being. On this desolate
soil,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>Before Cortez landed on Mexican soil the
star of these ancient peoples had already set.
Their oldest cities had their birth so far back
in the twilight of time that not even tradition
was able to tell the history of the tribes, the
causes that led to their decay or the time of
their disaster. Some traditions were told to
the Spaniards, but they are of such uncertain
origin that very little credence can be placed
in them. Upon the walls are sculptures which
speak to us in an unknown language; hieroglyphics,
and the chiselled types of a people long
since departed. The hieroglyphics would probably
explain all, but no interpreting key has
yet been discovered to give an explanation to
the writings. Some authorities assert, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
that Chichen Itza was inhabited at the
time of the Conquest. A Spaniard by the name
of Aquilar was wrecked on this coast and lived
with a powerful cacique for several years, but
he left behind him no written memoirs. At
any rate, it is known that the Spanish forces
occupied this place for at least two years. At
first the submission of the natives was complete,
but after a time they rallied from their
stupor, tiring of ministering to the insatiable
wants of their conquerors, and much severe
fighting followed.</p>

<p>Of the two great wells at Chichen Itza one
was used for the general water supply, the
<i>cenote grande</i>, and the other was reserved for
religious use exclusively, the <i>cenote sacra</i>.
Picturesque indeed must have been the throngs
of white-robed women who peopled the steps of
the <i>cenote grande</i> at all hours of the day to
fetch water for household purposes. They
probably carried double-handled urns on their
hips or shoulders just as their descendants do
at this present day. From far and near all
over Yucatan pilgrimages were made to the
sacred well, which was on the outskirts of the
city, just as pilgrimages are made to-day to
holy shrines by Catholics and Mohammedans.
It was this that gave the city its holy character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
Offerings of many kinds were made to
the deities. It is said that in time of drouth
offerings of precious stones and other valuables
were thrown into it, and in specially protracted
cases human beings were thrown into
it as sacrifices. Even after the time of the
Spanish conquest there are recorded instances
of pilgrimages to the sacred well for the purpose
of sacrificing slaves to relieve a drouth.
These victims were supposed to live even
after they had disappeared beneath the sacred
waters. A Spanish writer of the
time asserts that this was done as late as
1560.</p>

<p>The Chichen Itza of the olden times, filled
with pilgrims from far and near, would
scarcely be recognized in the place of to-day.
The jungle has gradually crept its way into
the very holy of holies. Columns have been
overthrown, and some of the structures have
been almost lost in a tangle of thorns and
creepers. Even in the last half century the
destruction and disintegration has been very
noticeable. To reach the place it is necessary
to ride about fifteen miles over a rough and
wearisome road. All around lie buried in thick
jungle ruins of palaces and other buildings.
Pyramid-like structures seem to have been one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
of the favourite forms of building. The most
imposing of these on this site rises sixty-eight
feet above the plain, and each side is almost
one hundred and seventy-five feet in length,
the whole covering about an acre of ground.
This structure is called the Castillo, although
it was really a temple. It is made up of nine
terraces of faced masonry, narrowing toward
the top, each one elaborately panelled to relieve
the monotony. On each side there is a
broad stairway, with a flight of ninety steps,
with stone balustrades, which are generally
carved to represent reptiles. A stone building
almost forty feet square crowns the summit.
The northern façade must have been very
striking before time and the destroying hand
of man wrought their work. There were no
doors on any of the buildings, and no traces of
hinges have been found. At the western base
of the pyramid is the walk that leads to the
sacred well. It is believed that on the top of
this pyramid the sacred rites of the priests of
their faith were performed, and it is said that
the sacrificial victims were led down these
stairways, then along the causeway and finally
cast into the sacred well. It is easy for the
imagination to picture the scene in all its
splendour of white-robed priests, smoking censors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
and—saddest of all—the victims bedecked
with garlands of flowers.</p>

<p>There are ruins of colonnades, courts, buildings
and other structures of which many columns
are standing at Chichen Itza, and it has
been called “the city of a thousand columns”
by some writers. One of the most important
monuments is the Nun’s Palace, as it is called.
It is not so large as others, but contains a
greater number of apartments. It is said to
have been the custom of these people to educate
girls of noble birth to the service of the
gods, on their attaining the age of twelve or
thirteen. Their service was similar to that of
the Vestal Virgins, although the vows were not
always perpetual. It was their duty to keep
the altar supplied with fresh flowers and to
sweep the temples. One group of structures
is called the Ball Court, as it is believed to
have been used for a game similar to the modern
basket ball. It consists of two perpendicular
parallel walls from north to south thirty-two
feet high, three hundred and twenty-five
feet long and one hundred and thirteen feet
apart. The ends of this quadrangle are each
occupied by a small temple. In the centre of
each wall, about fifteen feet from the ground,
there are two stone discs with holes through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
the centre, which seem to have had a part in
this or some other game. The vast proportions
of this court, or tlachtle, would seem to
indicate that this game was very popular with
the Yucatecos. Some of the well preserved
ruins present beautiful sculptured façades, to
which names have been given because of the
fancied resemblance to something. For instance,
one has been called the ruins of the
“House of the Tigers,” because of a frieze of
stalking tigers divided by richly fringed shells;
another round building, known as El Caracol,
“The Snail,” is the best preserved building at
Chichen; “The Red House,” and the “House
of the Dark Writing,” are still other structures.
In all directions for several miles the
bush is strewn with ruins. Crumbling walls
and courts overgrown with jungle growth are
encountered on every side, but because of the
disintegration these once splendid palaces and
temples are now little more than shapeless
masses of crumbled masonry. The human figures
seen on these monuments have the usual
types of the Toltec carvings on the plateaus
of Mexico. The total area covered by these
ruins has been estimated by some investigators
as high as ten square miles.</p>

<p>The next largest and most interesting city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
of ruins is known as Uxmal, which was the
capital of the Tutal Xiu branch of the Mayas.
This city is located between low ranges of hills,
perhaps one hundred miles from Chichen Itza.
When seen from an eminence a dozen or more
imposing structures of white limestone are
presented to view. This city, no doubt, supplied
a very important part in the early history
of Yucatan—at least if one is to judge
from its size. It is believed that this was the
original city of the Toltecs. A dozen or more
imposing structures of considerable size still
stand here that can be identified, in addition
to the large numbers of ruins which can
scarcely be outlined. The most notable sanctuary
of Uxmal, which is now known as the
“House of the Dwarf,” is over fifty feet high,
and also surmounts a steep-sloped pyramid
one hundred feet in height. Two stairways
on opposite sides lead to this building. It is
so named because the natives say it was built
by a savage dwarf in a single night. Long
after the city was abandoned this temple was
held in especial veneration. The Spanish
priests used to find offerings of cocoa and
copal on it, and they attributed this to devil
worship. Two lines of parallel walls, parts
of which are still standing, enclose a court or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
quadrangle, which is similar to the Ball Court
at Chichen. The group of buildings around it
encloses more than one hundred rooms. All
of the buildings seem to have been built on low
platforms or terraces. There is also at this
place a high terrace, or platform, that covers
over three acres of ground, and on which is a
second and a third terrace, upon the latter of
which is the ruin of a building known as the
Governor’s Palace. This building is one of
the finest samples of early American architecture
still extant. It stands at an elevation of
forty-four feet above the plains, and commands
a splendid view of the city. Its exterior
walls are decorated with sculptured masonry,
in the making of which it is estimated there
are upward of twenty thousand sculptured
pieces of stone. The building is three hundred
and twenty-two feet long, and is divided into
three parts by two arcades which pass clear
through. It is built entirely of stone without
ornament to a height of ten feet, then comes
a cornice, above which is a wall that is a bewildering
maze of beautiful sculpture. This
frieze has a row of colossal heads, and is divided
into panels which are alternately filled
with grecques in high relief, and diamond or
lattice work. All the lintels of the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
here are of wood in an excellent state of preservation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus48">
<img src="images/illus48.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN OLD CHURCH</p>
</div>

<p>At Uxmal there is a building called the
“House of Turtles,” because of a row of
turtles used as ornaments in the upper cornice.
It is the freest from ornamentation of any of
the structures. The turtles are found sculptured
at various places along the cornice. The
“House of the Pigeons” is the name of another
building, because of the fancied resemblance
to a dove-cote. The crest of the roof
is perforated with many rectangular openings—but
the resemblance for which the name is
given is very fanciful. At this site there were
none of the natural wells described at the other
city, but these people constructed some natural
reservoirs a short distance from the town in
which the rainfall was collected, and which
gave the necessary water supply for the people.
Furthermore, some of the buildings seem to
have had subterranean cisterns of large size
under them. Heavy rainfall occurs here for
about one-half the year, but during the other
half there is practically no rainfall, and water
becomes very scarce and valuable. The so-called
“House of the Nuns” is the largest
building and bears the richest and most intricate
carving at Uxmal. It is composed of four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
buildings, the largest of which is two hundred
and seventy-nine feet in length. The four
buildings enclose a great court, with sides two
hundred and fourteen and two hundred and
fifty-eight feet in length, the entrance to which
is through a high triangular-arched gateway.
This building originally contained no less than
eighty-eight apartments of various sizes. A
number of writers believe that many of these
buildings at Uxmal are comparatively recent,
because of the appearance of the stone and the
well-preserved character of the wood used in
the construction.</p>

<p>These structures are only a part of the ruins
that still remain, for the jungle on either side
hides the remains of what were once imposing
buildings. Many of these have been literally
torn asunder by trees, whose roots have forced
themselves between the stones and pried them
apart. No doubt this city once housed many
thousands of people, but to-day it is without
inhabitants. The pomp and glory of former
times have disappeared; and all is silent save
for the birds that nest in the trees and bushes.</p>

<p>The third city of ruins, Palenque, is situated
at a considerable distance south and west of
the two just described, and not far from San
Juan Bautista. Palenque, according to Charney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
was a holy city—a place for pilgrimage.
In the carvings neither sword, spear, shield
nor arrow appear. The representations are all
of peaceful subjects, usually a personage standing
with a sceptre and with prostrated acolytes
at his feet. From the expression one would
judge that they were worshippers, and not
slaves or captives. Their expression is always
peaceful and serene and that of worshippers
and believers. The city is built in the form
of an amphitheatre, on the lowest slope of the
lofty Cordilleras beyond. Its high position
affords a magnificent view over the forest-covered
plain below stretching as far as the
sea. In all the structures the builder levelled
out the ground in narrow terraces, on which
artificial elevations of pyramidal forms were
reared, and the hillside was faced with hewed
stones. At Palenque there are in all ten buildings
in view, each one crowning an elevation
artificially made. As one enters the grounds
there are several buildings to the right and
left, but directly in front are the remains of the
Palace. At one time this building has been
very large and imposing. Remains of a broad
flight of steps that led to the imposing entrance
corridor are in plain evidence. Flights of steps
led down to the first patio, which was surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
by lofty corridors with roofs of
pointed arches and which led into small apartments.
There were two of these patios in the
Palace of irregular size. Double galleries
which made a sort of cloister surrounded them.
Gloomy entrances from these corridors lead to
underground chambers, where there are tables
which are called altars, beds and dining tables
by different writers. A lack of system seems
to prevail in the building of the Palace. On
top of one of the walls two immense forest
trees are now growing. In the central portion
are the ruins of a tower, of which three stories
are still standing, with many windows. It is
a square tower ornamented to the north with
pointed niches; otherwise it is almost devoid of
ornamentation. On the contrary the galleries
are richly ornamented with medallions, probably
representing priests and priestesses.
Many human figures are sculptured in low relief
representing priests with mitres on their heads
and in uncomfortable attitudes. The faces are
oftentimes defaced in order to give an appearance
of ferocity. Some of the figures of the
deities are fantastic, monstrous and even terrible.</p>

<p>The Temple of Inscriptions stands on a hill
about fifty feet high. A magnificent view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
the ruins is afforded by this elevation, as
well as the broad tablelands surrounding.
There are three large mural tablets covered
with picture writing and hieroglyphs, supposed
to be copies of the laws of these ancient people,
in the building. Across a little valley over
which an aqueduct leads the land rises in terraces,
and is surmounted with artificially made
hills on which are the ruins of more buildings—two
Temples of the Cross and the Temple
of the Sun. The Temple of the Sun is almost
perfectly preserved. The interior is one large
room with a sanctuary at one end. In each
of these are mural tablets which contain what
is known as the Cross of Palenque. The cruciform
shape, such as the swastika and other
forms, is not uncommon among aboriginal people,
but this is what is known as the Latin
cross. Whether this arose by chance through
the invention of the artist, or the cross had
some religious significance among these people,
still remains an absolute mystery. Charney
asserts that it is one of the symbols of Tlaloa,
the god of rain, but other writers differ with
him. The body of the cross, which rests on a
hideous head, is sculptured in the centre, and
at the upper end are two human figures. On
one there is an inscription of sixty-eight characters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
which doubtless explain the ceremony
represented by the sculpture. Again it is surmounted
by the sacred bird of the Mayas, the
quetzal. In another this place is taken by a
representation of the sun with its spreading
rays. Where did the Mayas get their idea of
the cross so sacred among Christian people?
No one has yet been able to answer this question
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Who built these structures? For what purpose
were they reared? Various are the theories,
and many are the speculations covering
them. But authentic information is absolutely
wanting, and the passing years shed little
light. The modern Yucatecos are an attractive
people. No people in the world are pleasanter
or have more delightful manners than they.
The young women have a winning grace and
charm that is peculiarly their own. Their costume
is not greatly unlike that of the Tehuanas—and
it is fully as unique and becoming. It
is quite probable that their customs and characteristics
have not changed much since the
Spanish occupation. They have always been
an independent people, and have caused much
more trouble than the majority of the aboriginal
tribes of Mexico.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE</span></h2>

<p>The old-fashioned Don, accustomed to ox-carts,
wooden ploughs, and a horde of men
ready to serve him, no doubt views with dismay
the changes being wrought by steam and
electricity. The younger generation has been
educated abroad, or in the States, and rather
welcomes the innovations. The spirit of revolution
and political unrest that prevailed for
the first sixty years of the republic has lessened,
even if it has not entirely passed away.
Education and immigration have worked wonders
in the country; and, above all, the establishment
of a government that for almost a
third of a century commanded obedience at
home and respect abroad is responsible for the
mutation in Mexico. It was an absolute republic
and under a strong controlling hand. It
was the family government applied to the state,
for it was very paternal in its rule.</p>

<p>Mexico is a human country and is not without
its faults. The greatest of these are, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
the result of conditions for which the
present generation of nation-builders are not
responsible. A transformation can not be
wrought in a decade, nor in a generation. And
yet the real accomplishments of the past
twenty-five years in Mexico are marvellous.
Americans who have lived there during that
time wax eloquent in describing the great
change for the better. Whereas formerly people
hesitated to invest money for fear of political
changes, investments in that country are
now looked upon as safe, and Mexican securities
are given a fixed value on the bourses of
the world.</p>

<p>Modern luxuries and conveniences are being
introduced everywhere. The people are simply
installing in a hurry the things that other
countries have been acquiring for the half of
a century. Every city is bestirring herself,
and electric light plants, modern sewerage
systems and water works are being constructed
as rapidly as things can move in this land of
procrastination. Old and crude methods of
power are being replaced by up-to-date machinery
in mines and manufactures. Electric
railways are replacing the mule tram lines, and
the merry hum of the trolley is fast succeeding
the bray of the long-eared motor just mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
Mexico lagged behind so long that she
has had quite a distance to go, and it will be
a long while before she can entirely catch up
with the head of the procession. Material
wealth is increasing. Better wages are paid,
and the surplus is being expended for more
and better goods. The wants of the great bulk
of the people are so few, that it must be a long
time before there will be a great change in
their method of living; but their children are
being educated, and that in itself works wonders
in their uplifting.</p>

<p>For more than twenty years the finances of
the government have shown a surplus. What
a contrast to all the years of the republic before
that time. In 1876 the total revenue of
the government was but $19,000,000 silver.
For the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1910, this
had increased to $53,164,242 United States
gold. From a yearly deficit a surplus has been
evolved which annually amounts to several
million dollars. The total cash in the treasury
at the date of the above report amounted to
$37,042,857 gold. This statement shows a
healthy condition of affairs. The government
now finds willing buyers for its bonds, and all
its obligations have been met promptly for a
number of years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>Finance Minister Limantour, who held that
position for many years, proved himself to be
a Napoleon of finance, and his reputation extended
to every financial centre in the world.
Establishing the gold standard was a great
achievement. Just a few years ago Mexican
silver varied from $2.05 to $2.40 for a gold dollar,
and all business was unsettled as a result.
Now the government has established a rate of
exchange of two silver dollars for one of gold,
and all this was done without any friction or
disturbance. It is to be hoped that the new
administration will maintain the same high
standard of financial integrity that has been
handed down by its immediate predecessor.</p>

<p>The foreign trade of Mexico runs into big
figures. The total extra-territorial trade of
the republic for the year ending June 30th,
1910, amounted to $227,456,025 in United
States gold. Of this amount $130,023,135 represented
exports and $97,432,890, imports. Of
the exports $78,260,037 were of mineral products,
while vegetable products were less than
half that amount. An analysis of the imports
shows by far the largest items were included
under manufactured articles, such as machinery,
textiles, chemical products, etc. Arms and
explosives imported exceeded a million and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
half dollars in value, thus showing that the
government and people were even then preparing
for the struggle to follow. By far the
largest proportion of exports and imports was
with the United States. Imports from the
United States amounted to the tidy sum of
$56,421,551, an increase of twelve million dollars
over the preceding year, and the exports
to the United States were $98,432,859, an increase
of almost an equal amount. The United
Kingdom is the nearest competitor in the foreign
trade with our neighbouring republic.
While the imports from the United States
showed an increase of twenty-four per cent.
over the preceding year, the increase from the
United Kingdom and Germany was only twelve
and eighteen per cent. respectively. Imports
from the mother country, Spain, were less than
three per cent. of the whole.</p>

<p>In the matter of trade, as is shown by the
trade statistics, the United States is easily the
predominant factor. The proximity of the
country has probably been the cause of this,
as it has led Americans to investigate the natural
resources and invest money in railroads,
mines, public works and many other enterprises.
The same influence can be seen in the
banking interests. There are a number of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
strong banks in Mexico, of which the Banco
Nacional, or National Bank of Mexico, is the
most influential. This bank was established in
1881, at a time when the financial condition of
the country was anything but prosperous, and
its growth has been continuous and at times
almost phenomenal. This bank and one other
are the only institutions that have the privilege
of issuing bank notes in the Federal District,
although some banks in other parts of the
country have the same privilege. The Bank
of London and Mexico, originally a British
concern, but now owned by French capital,
ranks next in importance, although it is very
closely followed by the United States Banking
Company, an American enterprise with a number
of branches throughout the republic. There
are many other banks, some of them under the
banking laws of the republic, and others private
enterprises, which gives Mexico very good
facilities for the transaction of all kinds of
banking and commercial business. In 1893
there were only eight banks in the entire republic,
but now there are more than sixty.
They have a circulation of nearly $100,000,000,
and a capital in excess of that sum. The American
influence, and the banks controlled by
Americans, have aided greatly in the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
of business between the two countries,
and it is the writer’s belief that similar establishments
throughout the rest of Latin America
would be one of the greatest aids to the
extension of American influence and commerce
that could be devised.</p>

<p>The increase of manufacturing has been
quite noticeable in recent years, and eventually
will cause a diminution in the imports of certain
articles. Quite a number of cotton factories
have been established in certain sections
of the country, and the labour has been found
quite well adapted to that class of manufacturing.
Establishments for the preparation
and curing of meats have also been built under
government concessions, while tobacco factories,
which work up the very excellent tobacco
grown in the country, and breweries have been
established in many sections of the country.
The Mexican tobacco is said by those who pose
as experts to have a very excellent flavour, and
by many is claimed to be superior even to the
Cuban article. The product grown in the state
of Vera Cruz has the best flavour, but a number
of other states produce large quantities of
the weed.</p>

<p>The greatest enterprise now operating in
Mexico, excepting only the railroads, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
Mexico Light and Power Company, a Canadian
corporation. This group of men own the
electric light and gas plants and the tramways
of the City of Mexico, Puebla and a number
of other cities. As a part of their enterprise
they have built a great dam by means of which
the waters of the Necaxa River are utilized for
the production of the electricity. This is distant
ninety-six miles to the northeast of the
capital. Fed by springs this river becomes a
good sized stream before it plunges over a
precipice of four hundred and sixty feet, and
a short distance beyond is one of a still greater
fall. The main dam is one hundred and ninety-four
feet high and about thirteen hundred feet
wide, and contains an immense amount of material.
It is built of stone and concrete. By
means of this and the auxiliary dams a valley
has been made into an immense reservoir, so
that the dry season might be provided for
when the natural flow of water would be insufficient.
It is claimed that enough water can
be stored to run the power plant through two
years of continual drouth. The water is carried
to the turbines by means of pipes which
pierce the mountain, bringing to each turbine
a stream of water six feet in diameter and carrying
all the force of a drop exceeding one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
thousand feet. The total transmission lines
reach a length of more than two hundred miles,
and the capacity of the plant is two hundred
and fifty thousand horse power. At the present
time this company supplies all the electric
power in the capital, as well as several mining
enterprises, and as soon as the plant is wholly
completed, will supply Puebla and other cities.
Its franchise is from the Mexican government
and is in perpetuity. This simply gives an
indication of what can be done in the development
of the natural resources of Mexico. In
a country where fuel is scarce and high priced,
the value of the water power is accordingly
increased. There are many other waterfalls
awaiting development, and it only needs the
necessary capital, and a combination of far-sighted
men, such as those who compose the
Canadian corporation above mentioned, to supply
the great need of Mexico for cheap and satisfactory
power.</p>

<p class="caption">PRIMITIVE PLOUGHING NEAR OAXACA</p>
</div>

<p>It is unfortunate for Mexico that mining has
absorbed almost all of her energies, and agriculture
has been allowed to drop into a secondary
position. One cause for this has been the
Spanish characteristic, as represented by the
original conquerors, of seeking quick wealth
instead of attempting to coax out of mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
earth the treasure that she possesses. There
are labourers in plenty, if they are properly
instructed, but the <i>hacendados</i>, as well as labourers,
adhere to the most primitive methods.
It has been said that “earth is here so kind
that just tickle her with a hoe and she laughs
with a harvest.” This is not true of all parts
of the country, of course, for much of it is
mountainous and of a broken character, but
the statement will apply to large portions of
the republic.</p>

<p>The government of Mexico has endeavoured
to improve agricultural conditions by disseminating
information as to scientific methods of
cultivation, irrigation and fertilization, but
very little of it has had a noticeable effect.
The government has also distributed large
quantities of seeds and plants with little effect.
In most parts of the republic the land is tilled
just as it was four centuries ago. It is really
surprising that, in spite of these antiquated
methods, the results have been so good as they
are. As mentioned heretofore the wooden
plough with a small iron shoe, which merely
scratches the surface of the earth, is still used;
men may be seen cutting wheat with the sickle,
and much of the threshing is done by driving
horses and mules around a ring covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
grain, just as it was done in the old Biblical
days. The winnowing is accomplished by tossing
the wheat and the chaff into the air, and
then the grain is hauled to the <i>haciendas</i> or
markets in clumsy and ponderous two-wheeled
carts.</p>

<p>A <i>hacienda</i> run upon modern American
methods would certainly be a much more profitable
enterprise than when conducted after
this style. In a few sections of the country,
one will find a plantation here and there where
some new methods have been introduced and
American machinery employed, but these are
rare. Even in the Valley of Mexico, not far
from the City of Mexico, the most antiquated
methods will be seen employed at all times.
The richness of the land and its cheapness has
caused the floating of many land companies in
the United States. They can show great prospects
on paper, but the trouble is that many
of them have been floated by unscrupulous
men, who care nothing for the interests of the
stockholders, but are looking simply for promoters’
profits. When the real buyers reach
the land they discover that things are not as
represented, do not find conditions of living to
their liking, and in a very short time the whole
enterprise is dropped. Many have probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
lost practically all of their savings. These
things, of course, cannot be entirely guarded
against, and they certainly fail to prove that
Mexico is not a rich agricultural country.
They simply demonstrate what fraud can be
perpetrated upon people in a country where
the land is teeming with fertility. Land values
have undoubtedly advanced in the past few
years, and some enormous tracts have been
purchased by Americans, which are already
showing profits for the owners.</p>

<p>There has been much criticism heaped upon
the Mexican courts, and a great deal of it has
been deserved. The judicial system of Mexico
is copied rather after the French and Spanish
than the Anglo-Saxon system. In recent years
the procedure has been improved greatly, but
it still needs other changes in order to bring it
up to the twentieth century standards. In
years past American railroad engineers, who
were unfortunate enough to run over some one,
received harsh treatment in Mexican jails. The
law of <i>incommunicado</i>, by which an accused
person is locked up for three days, is still in
force. It used to be that a wounded person
could not be touched or moved before the arrival
of the authorities, which caused much
suffering; but this at least has been abolished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
The judicial system, which includes supreme
courts, district courts, circuit courts, police
courts and other minor courts, is intended to
give justice to the defendant in a criminal action,
and to both parties in a civil action, but
in many cases—to an American—the result
does not seem to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>The jury system is in use in Mexico, and nine
persons compose a jury. The jurymen may
consist of both natives and foreigners, but the
members must have some occupation, education
or independent means. The law provides
that the accused must be acquainted with the
names and number of his accusers, and must
be confronted with the witnesses who testify
against him. The testimony is all taken down
in longhand writing, which is a tedious process,
as followed out in Mexican courts. In criminal
cases it is generally read over to the witness
and signed by him, which method, although it
is cumbersome, sometimes gives a degree of
certainty and correctness to the testimony. It
is true that in many cases the points that are
raised by the accused are treated with very
little consideration. This is not the fault of the
law, but is the result of its maladministration
by the officials, just as similar instances are the
world over. Arrests of natives are made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
all sorts of offences, many of which are trivial,
and they are generally kept in jail for several
days before they are finally given a hearing.
Foreigners are usually treated with great consideration
and substantial justice is done them.
It probably is not good policy for citizens of
another country to criticise Mexico, when there
are so many blots upon the administration of
justice in every civilized country, and the
United States is not an exception. Local conditions,
public clamour and other things influence
the action of courts in Mexico, just as
they do in every other country.</p>

<p>In addition to the railroad connections the
steamship lines form a very important part in
the national transportation of Mexico. The
long coast line on both the Pacific Ocean and
Gulf of Mexico provides many ports. The
national traffic between these ports is quite a
considerable item, but the foreign commerce is
still greater. At the present time Mexico has
direct steamship connection with the United
States, Canada, Europe, South America, Central
America, the West Indies and the Orient.
The principal ports are Tampico, Puerto Mexico
(formerly Coatzacoalcos) and Progresso on
the Gulf, and Salina Cruz, Acapulco, Manzanillo,
and Mazatlan on the Pacific. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
in all more than twenty steamship lines that
have contracts with the government for carrying
the mails, and nearly all of these enjoy
subsidies of large or small amounts or enjoy
certain privileges or concessions.</p>

<p>The most important company operating is
the one known as the Ward Line, which conducts
a weekly service between several Mexican
ports, Havana and New York. This company
has some very good boats, and does a large
business between all of those ports. The Mallory
Line, the Mexican-American Line and the
Munson Line have regular service between
Mexican ports, Galveston and New Orleans.
There are also several companies that make
regular trips between Vera Cruz, Tampico and
European ports. On the Pacific coast the Kosmos
Line, operated by the Hamburg American
Company, have a regular service from Seattle
down the west coast of the United States,
Mexico, Central America and South America
to Europe by the way of the Straits of Magellan.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company
operate about three boats a month from San
Francisco to Panama, where connections are
made for New York and West Coast ports of
South America. The American-Hawaiian Company
have boats which sail between Hawaii<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
and Salina Cruz. There are also, in addition
to these mentioned, a number of coast lines on
both the Pacific and Atlantic side, which do a
considerable traffic between the various ports.
The Canadian-Mexican Pacific Steamship Company
recently began to operate boats between
Victoria, British Columbia and Salina Cruz,
and gives a monthly service between those
ports. In order to develop and facilitate this
coast traffic the Mexican government has spent
a great deal of money in providing harbours and
docks at a number of the smaller ports, in addition
to the larger enterprises that have heretofore
been described.</p>

<p>Mexico has not a great number of navigable
rivers. On the Pacific side the Mayo, the Yaqui,
the Balsas, the Rio Grande de Santiago and
one or two others are classed as navigable
streams, but because of bars and other obstructions
they can be used only by boats of comparatively
light draft. On the Atlantic side,
just below the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, is the
Grigalva River, which is a broad and imposing
stream. Large boats ply regularly up this
stream to San Juan Bautista, a distance of
about seventy-five miles. Small boats go up
still farther, the boat traffic extending clear to
the mountains. The Usumasinta River is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
affluent of this stream, and is navigable for
small boats even beyond the Guatemala border.
The Coatzacoalcos River, which flows into the
Gulf at the town of the same name, is quite an
important stream, and furnishes an outlet to
a considerable territory. The Papaloapan
River, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico near
Vera Cruz, has been dredged and made navigable
for a considerable distance into the interior.
It has proved a great benefit to many
small towns and plantations there situated.</p>

<p>North of Vera Cruz are the Soto La Marina,
the Tuxpan and the Panuco Rivers, all of which
are navigable for a hundred miles or more.
As an adjunct to the navigable streams and the
deep water ports the government is now building
an intercoastal canal, which is similar to
the one proposed along the Gulf coast of Louisiana
and Texas to connect the Mississippi and
Rio Grande Rivers. There are a series of lagoons
and small lakes that lie just a short distance
within the coast line, and which can be
connected and deepened. They will then form
a convenient and safe waterway for navigation.
The government is spending several million dollars
on the first link of this system, which will
connect the ports of Tampico and Tuxpan, a
distance of about a hundred miles. Half of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
section is already finished and in operation,
and it is estimated that in three or four years
more this part of the canal will be finished.
This waterway has a width of seventy-five feet
and a uniform depth of ten and one-half feet,
and will connect the mouths of the Panuco and
the Tuxpan Rivers. The Panuco, near Tampico,
is fifty feet deep, and the deepest draft
ocean vessels can come in and unload at the
docks of Tampico. The section of the canal
already opened is constantly filled with long
and narrow boats, manned by natives, which
are propelled by means of long poles when the
wind fails.</p>

<p>The opening of this section of the canal has
worked wonders in the development of this part
of the coast land, because it places the products
of the plantations and ranches within easy
reach of the markets. It has also served to
drain thousands of acres of land, which were
formerly considered to be of no use whatever.
On this route the canal passes through Lake
Tamiahua, which is seventy-nine miles long and
from five to twenty miles wide. Lake Tampamachoco,
a much smaller lake, will also be traversed
by this canal. The water in these lakes
is comparatively shallow, and it has been necessary
to deepen them considerably in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
make the canal of uniform depth with the other
portion. The distance between Tampico and
the mouth of the Rio Grande is about three
hundred miles, but a number of salt water lagoons,
which lie near the coast, can be utilized
as a portion of the canal. If this project, and
the similar one planned by the United States,
are completed, it will furnish a very long inland
waterway for the coast region. It will serve
the double purpose of draining and making
more healthful that portion of the country, and
likewise giving an outlet for the development
that will surely follow. The land when once
drained has been proved to be of unusual fertility.</p>

<p>The influence of the Anglo-Saxon in Mexico
has been very marked. What the English have
done in Argentina and many parts of the world,
the Americans have done in our neighbouring
republic. It is a significant fact that the Spanish
influences have been perceptibly disappearing,
while that of the Anglo-Saxon has been
in the ascendency. This change can be noted in
a great many ways, both in thought, customs
and foreign relations. This transition has not
been promptly recognized, and in some quarters
it has been strongly objected to by the
extreme conservative elements; but, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
it has been steadily marching on. Many
of the Mexicans prominent in the political and
business life recognize this trend and encourage
it, for they feel that Mexico needs Anglo-Saxon
methods and ideas in order to develop the country,
and give it the prestige that its importance
deserves. There are perhaps twenty or twenty-five
thousand Americans who permanently reside
in Mexico, and, in addition, there is the
effect of the many millions of American money
invested in the country, and the thousands of
tourists and business men who annually cross
the borders.</p>

<p>There is, doubtless, a strong prejudice against
the American and his methods in many parts of
Mexico, and this feeling seems to have been
somewhat intensified in the recent revolution.
It is not to be wondered at that such a feeling
exists. From first to last Mexico has ceded to
the United States almost one million square
miles of territory, which is almost one-third
more than the present size of the republic.
First came the separation of Texas, which was
undoubtedly due to the intriguing of Americans
who had crossed over into that section of Mexico.
These pioneers and adventurers brought
about the declaration of independence by the
Lone Star State. A few years later that territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
was admitted into the United States as
one of its integral parts. Then came the Mexican
War, which most of us admit was an unjust
war, and which resulted in the cession of more
than half a million of square miles of territory.
A few years later, by the Gadsden Purchase,
which was due to disputes over the boundary
line, another block of territory, as large as the
state of Ohio, was added to the domain of the
United States.</p>

<p>In the revolution of 1910 many Americans
crossed the border, joined the forces of the revolutionists,
and aided in the troubles of the then
existing government. Furthermore, very many
American tourists who visit Mexico make themselves
disagreeable by their actions and their
criticisms, which also add to the anti-American
feeling. So many include all Mexicans under
the general title of “greasers,” and can see no
good in anything that is not American. It is
a fortunate thing that the good people of Mexico
understand very little English; otherwise
they would frequently be excited to anger, if
they could hear the remarks that are made by
Americans in visiting their churches, battle
fields and other places surrounded by sacred
associations. They are not fools, however, and
even if they do not understand the words they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
can catch the trend of remarks by the gesture
and laugh that accompanies them. As the
Spanish race are exceedingly sensitive this lack
of sympathy and almost open contempt cannot
result otherwise than do injury to a general
good feeling. Some Americans grumble at
everything, get mad because all the waiters and
porters do not understand English, complain
about the hotels because they cannot obtain
everything just like they would in a Fifth Avenue
hotel, and, in fact, find fault with everything
that they see. As a contrast to this one
might consider the attitude of Mexicans. It is
difficult to do justice to the innate courtesy of
officials and people when Americans show them
so little. You can murder his beloved Spanish
in attempting to address a Mexican, and he
will listen with infinite patience and never a
smile of amusement or expression of vexation
on his face. The Mexican is polite not only to
his superiors and equals, but to his servants as
well.</p>

<p>The republic of Mexico has passed through
dark days. It has suffered from the evil government
of foreigners and from the reckless
ambitions of its own rulers. The burdens of
former mistakes still remain, and there is a
lingering distrust of the powerful republic to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
the north in many places. This distrust has
been fanned into greater intensity by recent
political agitators. The good sense of the leaders
will quickly reassert itself, however, and a
more perfect understanding will surely result.
American intelligence and capital have done too
much in bringing about the material prosperity
of the country for such conditions to exist permanently.
Mexico needs capital for the development
of her resources, and American capital
is most available for that purpose. Americans
will even be interested in the moral and material
advancement of their neighbours across the
Rio Grande.</p>

<p>To the reader who has followed this narrative
to the end, I give my valediction, <i>a la Mexicana</i>:</p>

<p><i>Adios! Vaya usted con Dios.</i></p>

<p>The broken character of the surface of Mexico
is shown by the many high mountain peaks
which are scattered over the country. Most
of these peaks are extinct volcanoes, although
one of them, Colima, is in constant eruption.
The following table gives the name, location
and height of all the peaks over ten thousand
feet in height:—</p>

<h3>III<br />
<span class="smaller">SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAVELLERS</span></h3>

<p>The visitor to Mexico will find few inconveniences
in the way of railway travel. The coaches
are, with only occasional exceptions, of American
manufacture, and the through trains on
most of the railroads have Pullman coaches at
fares that are considerably lower than in the
United States. It is well to make the trip going
and coming to the capital by different routes,
choosing the El Paso route for one trip and
the Laredo gateway for the other. If the visitor
is from the eastern part of the United
States, a sea voyage from either New York or
New Orleans to Vera Cruz makes a pleasant
variation to the monotony of railroad travel.
If bound for San Francisco one can travel
through the republic to Salina Cruz, and there
embark for that city. When the Southern Pacific
extension is completed to Guadalajara this
will also furnish another good way either to
enter or leave Mexico.</p>

<p>The Mexican customs examination is a very
formal affair and causes very little inconvenience
to the traveller, for the officials are usually
very courteous. An ignorance of the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
language will not cause a great deal of
trouble to the experienced traveller in the cities,
as it is a very easy matter to find some one who
can speak English. In the remoter districts
more trouble will be encountered, so that one
should have at least a few stock phrases to use.</p>

<p>The money of Mexico is easy for one to familiarize
himself with, as the peso is equal to fifty
cents in American money. The only inconvenience
at times is the trouble of carrying so
many of these pesos, each of which is the size
of one of our American silver dollars. The
minor coins are all on the decimal system, the
peso counting as one hundred centavos.</p>

<p>Hotel accommodation in the cities is fair,
although it will take the traveller some time to
get used to the large rooms that he will oftentimes
be placed in. The charges are generally
based on the European plan, but occasionally
one will find a hotel on the American plan, and
the charges are reasonable. On arriving at a
hotel the guest is usually shown a room, and,
if it is accepted, he may then register and his
name is written on a blackboard with his room
number. The cab charges are usually reasonable.
In the City of Mexico there are three
classes of cabs, indicated respectively by blue,
red and yellow flags, the latter being the cheapest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
class. The driver always expects a small
fee in addition to the regular fare.</p>

<p>Good stores will be found in the cities, and
the prices are not excessive. Most people are
interested in things that may be purchased as
souvenirs of the country. The famous drawn
work can be bought to the best advantage in
northern Mexico, and especially at Aguas Calientes.
Mexico is also noted for her onyx, opals
and the turquoise.</p>

<p>The proper clothing to be worn is that used
in the United States for spring or fall in the
higher altitudes, and a light coat should be a
part of the wardrobe. In the lower levels lightweight
summer clothing can be worn at all seasons
of the year. Most people visit Mexico
during the winter months, but summer, which
is the rainy season, is likewise delightful.</p>
